<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The Author had no intention during the cruise of writing
such a book. His reasons for now engaging in it
are, in addition to those common on such occasions, a
belief that the public take a very deep interest in the countries
which he has visited, and would be pleased to have
further means of information respecting them. The circumstances
under which his excursions into Egypt and
Syria were made, though limiting his observations to a few
cities, gave him some unusual advantages in examining
those to which he was allowed access.</p>

<p>The reader, he believes, will be surprised to see the
changes which the energetic government of Mohammed
Ali has wrought in Egypt and Syria; and these are only
the beginning of changes. The whole East seems destined
before long to a wonderful revolution, if not political, at
least mental and moral. It is pleasing to see the present
dawnings of light upon two countries the most celebrated
in the world; the one for its ancient science, the other for
its religion. The night appears to be past, and the day-spring
at hand.</p>

<p>The Author has given a <a href="#Page_167">chapter on Jerusalem, which
may appear to some of his readers better suited to a book
of romance than of travels</a>. His object was to place vividly
before the reader the ancient city, which he believes to
have had a splendor and a beauty of which few persons
are aware. Though the scene is supposed to be raised
up by a spell of fancy, yet there is nothing presented in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
the picture for which there is not authority in ancient
writers, with the single exception of the arrangement of
the hymns at the Paschal sacrifice.</p>

<p>The author, for reasons not necessary to be stated here,
kept no journal during this cruise; but the events and
scenes occurring in these visits made an impression so
deep that the memory has kept a record of them sufficiently
faithful. At the commencement of his attempt to
put them on paper, he wrote to Commodore Patterson to
ascertain whether such a design would meet with his approbation;
and the Commodore, in a very kind letter in
reply, was good enough to offer him the use of his own
private journal and of his official letters. From these
he has drawn much valuable statistical matter as well as
hints on other subjects; and he takes this mode of publicly
making his acknowledgments for the favor.</p>

<p>Through oversight, the year of these visits has not
been mentioned in the body of the work; they were made
in the year 1834.</p>

<p>“Land O!” was cried from our mast-head on
the morning of the 13th of July; and at the end of
an hour, a dim yellow line, resting on the southern
horizon, might be discovered from our elevated decks.
When another hour had expired, a high misty object,
that had drawn our attention, had taken distinctness
of outline, and was known to be Pompey’s Pillar.
By this time also the narrow strip of sand forming
the coast had begun to be ruffled, and soon after
the city of Alexandria, its domes, minarets, palaces,
and shipping, came into view. Notwithstanding the
evidence of life and activity that had now presented
itself, the scene was a melancholy one. Far off on
either side stretched the low, sandy coast, its uniform
outline unbroken except by a few insignificant
ruins; not a tree or shrub, not a speck of verdure,
was to be anywhere seen; while back from the
coast the atmosphere seemed to be on fire; a deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
red glare, covering all the land, and ascending far up
towards the zenith.</p>

<p>This was our first impression with regard to Egypt,
and the second was by no means a more favorable
one. Our ship was anchored about three miles
from the shore, and the schooner Shark, our consort
on this occasion, was directed to proceed into the
harbor, with an invitation to the U. S. consul,
Mr. J. Gliddon, to come on board. When he arrived,
he informed us that two cases of what seemed
to be the plague had appeared eight days previously
in the Greek convent, and had excited some alarm:
he added, however, that the building had been put
in strict quarantine, and as the disease had extended
no further, and the symptoms were not of a decided
character, their fears had subsided, and that they
were in hopes of enjoying their usual health. Their
expectations were encouraged by the fact that the
country had for many years been exempted from
this dreadful disease.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mohammed Ali was at this
time in Syria, whither he had been called to assist in
putting down a rebellion, which had suddenly burst
out there. Mr. Gliddon strongly urged the Commodore
to await his return; and informed us, that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the mean time we could visit Cairo and the Pyramids
with perfect safety, as that city and the intermediate
country were free from sickness, and our
route would not carry us through Alexandria or expose
us to contact with its inhabitants.</p>

<p>It was with the most sincere pleasure that we
learned that Commodore Patterson had decided in
favor of this excursion. Dim land of embalmed and
faded greatness, that, from the searments of the
tomb, dost murmur to us in solemn and mystic language,
we should see thee then! we should stand
on the banks of the Nile, where even Nature herself
is shrouded in unusual obscurity: we should
look down from the summits of the Pyramids, those
monuments on which all ages have gazed with wonder,
and where they have speculated in vain. I had
myself just been living in a squatter’s cabin in Indiana,
and anticipated with keen relish the strong
contrast that would here be presented. I had come
from witnessing the first elements of society forming
into order, to see the monuments of a people ancient
even in the most ancient times; from watching the
conflicts of separate individual interests, to behold the
“vast expanse of ages and nations;” from wandering
amid the primeval solitudes of nature, to wander
amid the solitudes of deserted cities; and from witnessing
the first efforts for human greatness to contemplate
its end.</p>

<p>Mohammed Ali had left as his representative, Boghaz
Bey, an Armenian of talent and energy, who enjoys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
his highest confidence; and while preparations
were making for our journey, the Commodore, with
Capt. Nicolson and Mr. Gliddon, went to pay him a
visit of ceremony. On application being made to him
for passports to Cairo, he replied, that they would be
unnecessary; that he would consider Com. Patterson
as the guest of the Pasha, and, as soon as we should
start, would forward orders by telegraph to the river,
to have boats provided, and to Cairo to have the
party treated with every attention.</p>

<p>On the 16th we transferred ourselves, together
with conveniences for cooking and sleeping, to the
decks of the schooner, and were landed towards
evening near the mouth of the great canal of Mahmoudieh.
This canal was the first of the many
proofs which our journey led us to witness of the
wonderful enterprize and energy of Mohammed Ali,
whom the reader, when he has followed us further,
will, I think, agree with us in considering
one of the greatest sovereigns of the age. In some
respects we must also allow his government to be
marked by singular short-sightedness and weakness;
but on this point it is only fair to let him
speak for himself, which we shall presently allow him
to do.</p>

<p>The traveller through Egypt is constantly struck
with two things: one, the high state of improvement
in all public institutions, and the energy with
which they are conducted; and the other, the vassalage,
the extremely abject state of the people. No subjects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in the world are in such a wretched condition as
those of the Egyptian Pasha. They have the appearance
of freedom, but throughout the whole country
every man is a slave to the royal master. They till
the land and may call the produce theirs; but when
it is gathered in, he compels them to carry it to his
store-houses, and there he purchases it at his own
prices, which are just sufficient to keep them from a
miserable death. The stores thus accumulated he
sells all over Europe, wherever a good market can
be procured; the money is laid out chiefly in the
support of his army and navy, and thus the avails
of their labor are returned to the poor wretches in
the shape of the “nezzam,” or soldiers to keep them
in subjection. Of course they hate both the Pasha
and all his armed forces most cordially; but for this
he cares nought, and thus we have the spectacle of
a nation apparently prosperous, but in reality extremely
miserable. He is so severe in his exactions,
that if a cultivator wishes to plant a tree, he must
provide an equivalent for the ground it may occupy,
and in one village up the Nile, where we stopped to
get vegetables, they informed us that they had none
for themselves. The last season their grounds, they
said, had not yielded the quantity of grain required,
and this year they had been compelled to convert
their gardens into wheat fields, in order to make up
the deficiency.</p>

<p>The annual revenue of the Pasha from all these
sources amounts in ordinary seasons to twenty-five,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and in very fruitful years to thirty millions of dollars.
In his own personal expenses he may be considered
very moderate; and nearly the whole of this
immense income is expended in public improvements,
and in the pay and equipment of his army and navy.
The former consists of 80,000 men, well disciplined,
and efficient, and strongly attached to their duties
and to the Pasha; the navy at present consists of
11 one hundred gun ships and as many frigates,
afloat, and is to be increased to 40 vessels, chiefly of
the largest class. The public improvements throughout
the country evince an enlargement of mind and
an energy of character that in an eastern sovereign
is wonderful, especially when we consider that in
most of his operations the Pasha has no one to
second him, but devises and executes by the force
of his own individual energy; and very often has
to give a personal superintendence to his operations.
With regard to the abject state of his subjects, he
says it is a necessary one, and is lamented by himself
as much as by any other person. His power
is unstable; he has lately gained a kind of slippery
independence, is closely watched by his former
master, the Sultan, and, without a large army
and navy, his throne would soon slide from under
him. His improvements, too, he says, must be carried
on with untiring assiduity, or they will result in little
good. His own life will probably not be continued
much longer, and if they are not well advanced
towards completion before his death, they will all be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
an abortion, and the country will retrograde to its
late state of inferiority, and be again behind the
character of the age. And in this he is correct; for
his step-son, Ibrahim Pasha, who will doubtless be
his successor, is altogether devoted to military affairs,
and cares little for manufactories, unless they be of
arms and munitions of war. “Therefore,” argues
the Pasha, (or thus at least argued the governor of
Cairo for him at our first interview,) “therefore I
must drive matters with the utmost speed, and to do
this I must have a large revenue, and to obtain this
I must lay heavy burdens on my subjects.” He says,
however, that as soon as the cause of these exactions
is removed, and his power secured, and his improvements
sufficiently advanced to fear no relapse, he
will make his people comfortable; and that in the
interval, by means of schools and his own example,
he is endeavoring to inform them, and to stimulate
them to higher views of things than they have
hitherto had, and greatly to increase the resources of
the country. Thus speaks the new monarch of Egypt,
and I have thought it best to give the reader at once
an insight into his views, in order that he may be able
the better to judge of them as we proceed through
the country.</p>

<p>We now return to the canal of Mahmoudieh.
Fifteen years ago there was a scarcity of grain in
Europe, but a great abundance in Egypt, and the
merchant-sovereign had an opportunity of realizing
an extremely handsome profit on the products of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
soil; but the Nile happened at that season to be unusually
low, and vessels found it so difficult to load
at the mouth of the river, that his harvest of gain
was in a great measure lost. He then conceived the
idea of a canal to unite the river with the secure and
excellent harbor of Alexandria. With him there is
but a short interval between planning and executing.
He sent his soldiers into the country with requisitions
on the various governors for men, according
to the size of their villages or districts. The poor
natives were hunted up, and being fastened to long
poles by iron collars around the neck, forty to a pole,
were thus driven down to the line marked out by
his engineer, and there set to work. Mr. Gliddon,
who saw the work in progress, informed me that
there were 150,000 men employed upon it at one time.
In six months the canal was completed, with the
exception of a little masonry, and was opened for use.
It is sixty miles in length, ninety feet wide, and
eighteen in depth, including six feet of water. The
workmen had no tools, except a few hoes to break
the hard upper crust: when this had been done, they
scraped the earth together with their fingers, formed
it into balls, and passed them by hand to the sides
of the canal, a large portion of the wet mass often
escaping between their hands while on the way.
Exposed to the sun, and without shelter at night,
and probably without sufficient food, disease crept
in among them; and I was credibly informed that during
the digging, 30,000 of the workmen perished:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
their bodies, as soon as life was extinct, were tossed
upon the growing heaps of earth at the side, and this
was their burial. The canal follows the line of that
dug by Alexander the Great, till near Damanhour,
when it unaccountably makes a great bend to the
south. The engineer has made another blunder in
the grading, in consequence of which it is too shallow
to be navigable during the two months when
the river is at the lowest.</p>

<p>Mr. Gliddon, whose kindness on this and other occasions
has placed us under many obligations, had secured
boats for us, and towards sunset our arrangements
for the inland voyage were completed. We then
hoisted the American ensign at the peaks of our little
flotilla, and dropping the large sails to a fresh and favorable
breeze, the city and its shipping soon glided
from our sight. After passing near the elevated
ground on which stands Pompey’s Pillar, and then
by a few country-seats of the nobles of Alexandria,
we entered upon an open, dreary waste, and night
began soon after to sink around us, and upon the
still and melancholy scene; for, except our rushing
boats, not a sight nor a sound met the senses, which
soon became actually oppressed by the solitude. A
dim moon threw a flickering and uncertain light
upon the banks, and it required but little effort of the
imagination, as we watched them flitting by, to make
out shadowy forms, and cover the place with the
phantoms of the many poor victims sacrificed and
buried there.</p>

<p>But had they actually risen up, the whole 30,000,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and pointed their bony fingers and gibbered at us as
we passed, they would scarcely have exceeded in numbers
or terror the blood-thirsty tormentors that soon
after this assailed us in the little cabins in our boats.
We had extinguished our lights and laid down for
repose, but repose there was none for us. The reader
must excuse me if I draw such a nauseous picture;
it is not fair that he should travel without
sharing some of the pains of travelling, nor can he
otherwise get a correct idea of the country. We
soon found ourselves literally covered with vermin,
whose bite, though dreadfully annoying, left us uncertain
whether they were the animal that sometimes
chooses our beds for their residence, or those
that constituted the third plague of Egypt; and during
the long night, while stung almost to madness,
we were left to weigh the evidence in this agreeable
query. The latter insects are, at certain seasons, common
in every part of Egypt; and Sir Sidney Smith,
having removed his tent to the desert, in order to
escape from them, found them even among its sands.
It was really quite a relief to us, when morning
came, to find that our clothes were thickly sprinkled
over with only the former less terrible insect. It was
a long and wearisome night. I climbed the mast
once or twice to cool my blood and seek for relief by
gazing around; but only a flat, and utterly deserted
country met the sight, and the ear could not detect
a single sound; the hooting of an owl would have
been a pleasant relief.</p>

<p>Morning did come at last; and as the sun began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to throw its welcome beams over the landscape, if
landscape it may be called, the banks of mud bordering
the canal grew higher, and receded on either
side, until presently we found ourselves in a kind of
basin, and soon after amid a multitude of boats.
We had arrived at its termination. Casting our
eyes on the left bank, where there seemed to be
something in motion, we were able, by and by, to detect
a village stuck into its side; the houses, or rather
the single small chamber forming each house, being
made partly by digging into the bank, and partly
by building up a low wall of mud, with an opening
in its front for a door. They were covered with
reeds, and these again with mud. Creeping in and
out, were a swarm of natives, in soiled habiliments,
as dark looking as the houses themselves. This, together
with some store-houses of the Pasha at the
gate of the canal, and a few more decent dwellings
on the banks of the river, form the village of Atf.
On the right bank of the canal was a well paved
quay, lined with boats, and covered with heaps of grain.</p>

<p>We ascended the steep, high banks on the right of
this quay,&mdash;and had before us the Nile.</p>

<p>I believe we shall not soon forget the impression
it made on us; for it is, there, a beautiful river, and
its effect was heightened by contrast with the dull,
monotonous scene presented by the black sides of
the canal and the deserted country around. The
Nile is about as wide as the Connecticut at Hartford
or the Ohio at Cincinnati; it flowed here at our feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in graceful and beautiful curves. In front of us was
an island, low and flat, but covered with millet, and
with shrubs and plants of the most intense verdure.
A little higher up, on the opposite bank, from amid
a mass of houses, towered the domes and picturesque
minarets of Atfour, a city of 40,000 inhabitants,
with a large building like a palace at its upper edge.
Just above this was another island covered with
trees, which were dipping their foliage into the waters,
and behind which the river was lost to our sight.
On our own side the view was less interesting.
Only a few trees dotted the banks, and in the interior,
the dreary stretch of flat, waste land was interrupted
only by the deceitful <em>mirage</em> or imitation of
water.</p>

<p>While some of the party were looking down on
the river in high admiration of its modern beauties,
or lost in meditations on its ancient fame, old Catalina,
the Mahonese woman who attended on the
Commodore’s family, approached. Catalina had
never seen any thing larger than the rivulet which
flows near her native city, and is much frequented
by the Mahonese washerwomen. The company
watched her in order to enjoy her surprise. She
was, indeed, surprised. When she had a little recovered
from her astonishment, one of the party said
to her, “Well, Catalina, what do you think of the
Nile?” “Oh,” she replied, with sincerity and earnestness,
“it is very grand&mdash;if it was only at Mahon,
what a fine place it would be to wash clothes in!”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Boats on the Nile. Our enjoyments on the river. Water of the
Nile. Villages. Ovens for hatching chickens. Egyptian bricks
and case of the Israelites. Singular costume of the females.
Thievish boatmen. First view of the Pyramids. Stupendous
undertaking of Mohammed Ali at the Barage. Approach to
Cairo. Moonlight scene.</p>

<p>The boats of the canal are confined exclusively
to its waters, and we here found it necessary to look
out for other conveyances, a necessity to which our
last night’s experience made us very gladly submit;
nor had we at any time occasion to find fault with
the comfort or cleanliness of the boats on the Nile.
Those which we engaged had about three fourths
of the length of one of our canal boats, and about
twice the breadth, and drew from three to four feet
water; near the stern were a forward and an after
cabin, the former of sufficient height to allow us to
stand upright. In front of it we spread awnings
above, and at the sides, so as to make a cool verandah
or vestibule for eating and sitting during the
day; and, with the aid of curtains, a pleasant sleeping
apartment for the night. Towards the bow the
deck ceased, and gave place to an open area filled
with sand, where our excellent cook erected his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
throne, and chopped off as many heads as might
have satisfied even Mohammed Ali himself.</p>

<p>Our party, consisting of twenty-six persons exclusive
of attendants, engaged three of these boats. The
Commodore and his family, and, by invitation, &mdash;&mdash;, and
the writer of this, occupied one of them; a second
was engaged by a party principally of lieutenants;
and a third by midshipmen from the two ships.
We had on board of each boat a person called a Cavass,
an officer appointed by government to attend
on travellers; he goes well armed, and bears in addition,
as a badge of office, a long cane capped with
silver or gold, to which dangle chains of the same
material. His presence places the party under the
protection of government, and gives it access to all
public places to which he may choose to lead.</p>

<p>We were all a happy party on that river. Our
steward had laid in abundantly, and provisions along
the Nile were plentiful and cheap; we had books
and musical instruments, and chessmen and society.
We changed back and forward among the boats, and
sometimes gave tea-parties; and often landed for
a stroll along the river banks, or among the palm-groves
of the villages. The officers unanimously
voted that it was far preferable to keeping watch on
shipboard. Nor must I forget another source of
real and actual pleasure, in drinking the Nile water.
It is a delicious fluid, and the natives have a saying
handed down from father to son, “that if Mahomet
had ever tasted the waters of the Nile, he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
have placed his Paradise along its banks.” An
earthern vessel, that would hold twenty or twenty-five
gallons, was lashed at the stern of our boat, and
kept filled, so as to allow the sediment to subside.
The river, when we were ascending, was about one
fourth advanced in the yearly flood, and the waters
were of a light yellow color; on being allowed to
rest in the jar, they took the color of lemonade, and
were the most agreeable we had ever tasted. We
drank prodigious quantities, but without having our
health at all affected by them. The wind at this
season blows constantly up stream during the day,
but subsides a little after sunset, when we were
obliged to come to and secure ourselves to the shore
for the night. Descending boats take advantage of
this interval of calm to drop down with the current.</p>

<p>We stopped first at Atfour, the city noticed above,
where we found that what had seemed to us a palace
was a large manufactory of Egyptian caps belonging
to the Pasha. Thence we glided up the
stream, the American ensign at the peak of each of
our high lateen yards, fluttering, and seeming to rejoice
as much as we at being on the Egyptian river.
The banks, villages, islands, and groves, slipped along
by our sides, presenting views sometimes highly
picturesque, and always of a strikingly oriental
character. The country, however, is generally at
this season of the year tame and monotonous. The
crops had been gathered in, and the open plains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
(for there are no enclosures, except occasionally
to a garden) were burnt to a cinder by the fierce
raging sun; the earth was gaping, and seemed to
pant under its fury; and, except the neighborhood
of the villages, and now and then a garden watered
by artificial means, there was not a speck of verdure
to be seen. The villages also, when we
came to inspect them, we found to be miserable in
the extreme. They consist of one or two hundred
houses, made of bricks hardened in the sun and covered
with domes of the same material. The bricks
retain the original color of the muddy deposite, and
the villages have a dull, gloomy appearance. Whitewash
is never used within; but on the outside a mottled
appearance is sometimes given to the houses by
the custom of sticking cakes of camels’ ordure against
their front and sides to dry; this being the only fuel
used in the country. It is said to burn very well,
and when thus prepared, to have no disagreeable
odour. If the reader will imagine a collection of
houses thus daubed on the outside, with earthern
floors and bare walls of mud, a small hole for a
window, excessively filthy within, and abounding in
vermin; he will have an idea of an Egyptian village.
He must add also now and then a large, well-filled
granary of the Pasha in the neighborhood of the
villages; and in the villages themselves a number of
dwellings in ruins; for the bricks often yield to the
operation of the weather, and the badly constructed
domes tumble in. As we sailed along, our attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was very often drawn to the houses for hatching
chickens, one or more of which may be seen in each
of their villages. They are formed by taking a
number of pots, of the capacity of about a gallon,
contracted at the neck, which is turned towards the
exterior. About fifty or sixty of these are built up
with bricks and mud into an edifice like an elongated
bee-hive, twelve or fifteen feet in height. The
eggs are small and the fowls diminutive, but of a
very pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>I examined the Egyptian bricks with reference to
the complaint of the Hebrews, that straw was not
allowed them in the manufacture. A few here have
straw mixed up with them, and it will doubtless
check the process of disintegration to which they are
exposed, but it does not seem at present to be considered
a necessary ingredient. But it is universally
employed in the process of manufacturing, or rather
in drying the bricks. They are in size like our
bricks, and are cut with a spade from the earth when
moistened by the yearly floods. Fine straw is then
scattered on the adjoining grounds, and the bricks
are spread over this to dry; and were this precaution
not used, the bricks in drying would adhere to
the earth and be spoiled. I conclude, then, that here
was occasioned the dilemma in which the Israelites
soon found themselves; they could make the tale of
bricks, but when they came to remove them at the
close of their labors, they found them attached to
the soil and their labors lost. I frequently saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bricks exposed for drying, but never without a layer
of fine straw beneath.</p>

<p>Their villages occur at intervals of five or six
miles; generally they are on the river bank, but are
often scattered over the interior, and with the groves
of the graceful palm-tree often formed pretty groupings
in the landscape. The natives are of a light
ash color; and the men, though rather slender, are
remarkably well-formed, light, and active, and capable
of enduring fatigue. Their dress is sometimes
like that of the Turks, but often simply a long piece
of white cloth, like the Roman toga, wrapped around
the body, with the ends thrown across the shoulders
or supported under the arm; it is a graceful, but
not very modest dress. But the women! How
strange are the caprices of fashion, and often how
extravagant and silly! In Turkey a woman is not
allowed to show her face at all; a handkerchief
drawn across the forehead, and another just below
this, so as to cover all the face, and leave room only
for the eyes to fall bashfully on the ground and
pick out the lady’s way, secures their modesty. In
Egypt a lady may expose all her face except the
nose and mouth: these it would be the height of indelicacy
to exhibit, and she protects them by a strip
of black cotton stuff (black, think you!) about three
feet in length and four inches wide. One end of
this is fastened by a string passing across her forehead
and tied at the back of her head; the cloth
falls down over her nose and mouth, and the lady’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
modesty is secure. It would be well for them to
cover all the face, for a more ugly set of ladies I
have never met with in any country. The Turkish
costume has at least the advantage of making us
<em>imagine</em> beauty; and many a stranger is put in raptures
of love by a pair of flashing eyes glancing on
him from beneath the jealous muslins, when, if the
covering was removed from the face, he would be
ungallant enough to turn with disgust from both
face and eyes. The Egyptian ladies show a want
of taste in not adopting the Turkish fashion.</p>

<p>At one of the villages, called Negila, we saw some
of the dancing girls of the country. They were
dressed in the national costume, but were decked off
with beads and a great variety of tawdry ornaments,
and were disgusting objects. Here is a large granary
belonging to the Pasha, with vast stores of every
kind; in our way to and from it we were beset with
beggars, whose appearance exhibited the utmost
wretchedness.</p>

<p>The breeze was fresh and our boats were comfortable,
and the banks and the hours glided swiftly
along. We had music, we played chess, we read, we
chatted, we dozed when we preferred doing so.
When meal-time came we slipped the leather trunks
together for a table, and brought good appetites to
the repast. Cleopatra herself had not a more cheerful
party than ours.</p>

<p>Our boatmen often amused us by their agility.
The sand banks at the bends of the river are planted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with water-melons, and as the flood was beginning
to reach the fruit, the inhabitants were busy gathering
it in, though it was not yet fully ripe. The
Arabs of our boat would often make a dash at these
melons, and would have just time to select the best
when the owners would rush with cries to the scene
of plunder. Down they would all go together into
the river, flouncing and tugging; the one for revenge,
the other, amid so many witnesses of his exploit,
struggling for fame as well as for the water-melon,
and pushing it before him with all his might. Sometimes
they would grapple, and in the consequent
struggle of fierce passions the melon would escape
from both, and glide quietly down the river: but
generally the boatman succeeded in depositing it
safely under the wing of the Cavass.</p>

<p>Towards evening of the 17th we came to a range
of sand hills stretching along on our right; they are
the commencement of the chain that higher up
assists in forming the valley of the Nile. Up to this
point our view on either side took in an unbroken
level as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p><em>The Pyramids.</em>&mdash;It was with a thrill of joy that,
on the morning of the 18th, as we sat at breakfast,
at an exclamation from one of our party, we looked
up, and saw before us the Pyramids. We were then
twenty-four miles distant, but, though thin and airy-like,
they were very distinct. These monuments
are most impressive when the spectator is either
close beneath them or at a distance like this. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the present occasion they produced a very powerful
effect. Their regularity of outline kept their
impression clear on the mind as works of art; their
shadowy appearance showed them to be very distant,
while their great elevation at so remote a point
affected the mind strongly with their astonishing
vastness. They were in sight, with brief intervals,
during the whole day, and to the last were grand and
sublime objects.</p>

<p>About noon we found ourselves approaching a
spot, in which, from the representations of our Cavass,
we had become highly interested. We were
near the head of the Delta, a place which Mohammed
Ali has selected for a work, which, if successful,
will place him far above the constructors of the Pyramids,
and make him one of the greatest benefactors
that Egypt has ever known. The place opened
upon us at length, but on looking up our first impression
was one of deep and unqualified disgust.
Before us was a busy scene. On the high bank at
our left men were appearing in great numbers, with
baskets of earth in their hands, and after discharging
it down the bank, were retiring to give place for
others; but as they stood out in strong relief against
the sky, we could see others with whips, which they
were using freely upon the poor wretches, whose
writhings and accelerated movements gave proof of
the smart.</p>

<p>We stopped on this occasion only to take a glance
at the <em>Barage</em>, for so this place is called; but on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
our return from Cairo gave it a careful examination,
and, by the politeness of the chief engineer, M. Lenon,
were furnished with plans and explanations.</p>

<p>The traveller along the Nile is everywhere struck
with the great value of irrigation to these lands.
Water is frequently raised from the river by wheels
turned by oxen or camels, and sometimes by buckets
swung at the end of a pole and worked by men;
and wherever this is done, we found, even at midsummer,
gardens of the most intense verdure and of
extreme luxuriance. It may be doubted, indeed,
whether the annual floods do not benefit the country
quite as much by the irrigation as by their muddy deposites.
The object of the Pasha is, by means of
dams, to raise the waters of the river to the surface
of the adjoining country, and enable the cultivators
to carry it by canals to any part, and to irrigate
the whole region freely, wherever they may
choose, and the place we were now at is the one
which he has selected for this great undertaking.
The idea of this is not quite a novel one, but was first
grasped by the capacious mind of Buonaparte, between
whose character and that of the Egyptian monarch,
there is, by the way, quite a strong resemblance.</p>

<p>The reader will remember, that of the seven mouths
by which the Nile formerly discharged itself, only
two remain; one, the eastern, passing into the sea
at Damietta; while the other, or western, discharges
itself in a similar way near Rosetta. The Delta, lying
between them, is of extreme fertility. Should he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
succeed, not only will the productions of this be
greatly increased, but, by leading the waters off east
and west of it, he will be able to redeem from the
encroaching deserts an immense extent of country
now quite abandoned. But difficulties of an alarming
kind present themselves. The bottom of the
river is loose and unstable; and the shores are so
friable, that if an attempt is made to build a dam
across it at once, the water will, in the mean time, be
working out for itself new channels along the sides.
Minds like that of Mohammed Ali, however, are only
stimulated, not discouraged, by serious obstacles. He
has employed M. Lenon, a French gentleman, and
self-taught, but an engineer of superior abilities; and
trusting the whole matter to him, has given him, as
a nominal superior, Mahmoud Bey, the late governor
of Cairo, one of the most wealthy men of the country,
and apparently an agreeable coadjutor in this great
undertaking. The <a href="#Nile_delta">subjoined plan</a> is copied from
one drawn for us by M. Lenon, and the measurements
were also furnished by him.</p>

<div id="Nile_delta" class="figcenter" style="width: 547px;">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="547" height="650" alt="Nile River Delta." />
</div>

<p>In this <em>A</em> represents the river before branching,
<em>B B</em> the Rosetta, and <em>C C</em> the Damietta branch. It
is proposed to build a dam across at <em>E</em> and <em>e</em>, sufficiently
high to elevate the waters nearly to the level
of the banks, which are here about thirty feet above
the usual surface of the river. The engineer commences
with cutting the canals <em>F F</em> and <em>f f</em>, each
thirteen hundred feet wide and thirty-two in depth,
leaving cross strips at <em>L</em> and <em>l</em>, until the canal is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
ready for use. Across these canals at <em>G</em> and <em>g</em>
dams are to be constructed forty-one feet in height,
including the foundation, and a hundred and twenty-eight
in thickness; and in them are to be left sluices
of sufficient capacity to allow the passage of the entire
river. When these are completed, the sluices
are left open, and the cross slips at <em>L</em> and <em>l</em> being
cut away, the river seeks the more direct passage,
and leaves the old channels <em>M</em> and <em>m</em> nearly dry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Piles are now to be driven into the bottom of the
river, and in these the dams <em>E</em> and <em>e</em> are to be constructed;
the former one thousand, and the latter
eight hundred and twenty feet in length, each thirty-four
feet in height. These being completed, the
sluices are to be closed, and the water is thus carried
to the required height. By means of the canals
<em>I</em>, <em>I</em> and <em>K</em>, it is to be carried over the Delta, and in a
similar manner is also led off to the east and west, as
far as they may desire. In this latter operation they
will be assisted by the nature of the ground; for
here, as along the Mississippi and the Ganges, the
ground immediately adjoining the stream is higher
than at places more remote. At <em>K</em> will be a gate for
checking the flow of water, and at <em>H</em> and <em>h</em> small
canals, with locks, for boats passing up and down the
river. An immense water power will be thus created
at the Barage; and it is in contemplation to
erect there mills and manufactories of every species;
and also to lay out a city after the European plan.
Cairo will probably find here a formidable rival.</p>

<p>This is a great undertaking, whether we consider
the advantages which it promises or the startling
boldness of the design; for in our country we can
scarcely form an idea of the difficulties that beset it
on every side. Every thing, even the most trifling
kind of tool necessary in the operation, has first to
be made. Mons. Lenon informed us that he could
not have found things less prepared for his hands, if
he had commenced operations in the midst of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
African deserts. And, in addition, both he and the
sovereign have to encounter the ignorance and the
prejudices of the jealous officers of the court. They
came once to Mohammed Ali, complaining that
the engineer was going to needless expense in importing
wood for piles when they had trees enough
at home, which, if spliced, would answer just as well.
“Say you so,” replied the Pasha, “the experiment
shall be made forthwith;” and looking out into his
garden, he ordered trees at once to be cut down, and
sent the complainants to see them spliced and arranged
to their own satisfaction. This was done; the pile-driver
was applied to them, and at the first stroke
they flew into shivers. Since that time they have
been more cautious in making complaints.</p>

<p>We found 10,000 men at work digging the canals;
6,000 on the Rosetta side and the balance on the
Darietta branch. Mons. Lenon says, that if he can
get men enough, he will finish it in three years: but
at the present mode of working, it will require six
or seven. They broke ground three months previous
to our visit. One hundred great dredging machines
are to be employed, thirty of which are already
on the ground. These, as well as most of the tools,
have to be imported from Europe. In the latter they
are yet very badly provided. The ground is broken by
hoes, and worked into baskets with shovels or fingers,
as the case may be: these are carried on the head to
the side of the river, and there emptied down its
banks. The men are divided into companies of from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
thirty to fifty each, with one or two drivers, who
hasten their operations by a free use of whips.</p>

<p>This inhumanity must not be laid to the charge
of the engineer, who has in several ways endeavored
to soften the hardships of their condition. We
found him erecting hospitals, and conveniences for
grinding corn and cooking; and he has prevailed
on the Pasha to allow them wages, a thing heretofore
quite unknown. They receive each thirty-six paras, or
four and a half cents per day, from which six paras
are deducted for their board. This in Egypt may be
considered pretty handsome wages.</p>

<p>At our second visit we stopped at the tent of
Mahmoud Bey, whom we found to be a fine specimen
of the Turkish gentleman. He is a venerable
looking man, with a splendid white beard falling
over his breast. The tent was of mammoth dimensions,
carpeted, and ornamented within with stripes
of cotton or silken stuffs of gay colors, producing a
rich and pleasing effect. His attendants brought
fruits, coffee, and pipes with mouth-pieces set in diamonds.
At Mons. Lenon’s tent we found the chief
of the St. Simonians, who had lately been banished
from France, and had taken refuge in this country.</p>

<p>Before dismissing the Barage, I should add a fact
mentioned to us by Mons. Lenon, that in digging
here they have come to bricks at the depth of sixty
feet from the present surface of the ground.</p>

<p>But our boat is once more out upon the stream,
and we are gazing upward, expecting each moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to see Cairo open to our view. Instead of the city
however, came a hurricane, sweeping across from
the western desert, and filling the air with a blood-red
color and our eyes with sand. We took refuge
under one of the high banks, and hugged the shore
closely till it had passed. Again a little after sunset
we gained the channel, and by the light of a dim
moon glided onward towards the city. On our left
soon appeared a mass of white houses, forming the
Pasha’s summer palace of Shubra: it is surrounded
by a garden forming a perfect fairy scene,
and is connected with Cairo, three miles distant, by
an avenue of noble trees. Of all this on the present
occasion we got but an imperfect view; soon after
several other large white edifices came in sight, and
our imaginations, excited by the glimpses of splendor
which we had caught, by the time, and the country,
worked each into a scene of eastern enchantment, and
we pictured in each of them fair captives from other
countries, gazing through the lattice, and sighing for
their distant native hills. The boat glided on, and
presently our sympathies were interrupted by the
glancing lights of the busy little town of Boulac,
the port of Cairo. This city, as the reader is perhaps
aware, is not situated on the river, but about a
mile and a half from it on the west, and has at Boulac
a landing-place and store-houses for all goods coming
from the north; Old Cairo, a few miles higher up,
answering a similar purpose for all vessels coming
from up the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was too late to proceed to the city, we ran
our boats across to the shore opposite Boulac, and
made fast for the night near a summer palace and
gardens. After tea we climbed the high bank over
our boats to get once more a view of the Pyramids,
now about eight miles distant on the west, but in
the moonlight quite distinct.</p>

<p>There was something pleasing in being made to get
our first impressions of this ancient region by moonlight.
We were now amid the scenes of the earliest
grandeur of Egypt. On one side of us, and but a
few miles distant, had once stood the great city of
Heliopolis; and on the other Memphis. Dim land
of shadows and mystery, the pall of death hath been
laid upon thee; but instead of concealing, it only
makes thy features more solemn and more awful.</p>

<p>What a scene of life and bustle was once upon
this now silent plain.</p>

<p>Ye buried ages, whose monuments stand yonder
in the glimmering light, I have received the
wizard’s spell, by which the entombed are brought
to life once more; and lo, I spread it over you.
Arise!</p>

<p>Ha, this is Memphis! And see how it stretches
across, and covers all the plain. Towering aloft, is
many a grave but magnificent temple; there stretches
the deep shadowed and interminable colonade; here
frowns the massive tower for defence; and there lies
concealed the luxurious bower of the gay. Dwellings
of the simple and the astute, the noble and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the lowly serf stretch around, far as the eye can
reach, and countless multitudes flock along thy
streets; while here, closer to us, in the city of mummies,
lie an equally countless number in the searments
of the grave. City of many centuries and of
stately grandeur, we yield thee the reverence&mdash;but
what noise is that? the buzz of the multitude has
suddenly changed, and now comes the sound of
wailing on the ear; and mark, how it increases in
intensity, and spreads; and now all the land is filled
with woe. The cause&mdash;I have it now&mdash;their god
Apis is dead. A white bull, fed solemnly and reverently
in their temples, and to which all the land
bowed down in worship, has suddenly expired, and
the houses are all filled with alarm and woe.&mdash;And
here comes a long procession, sweeping onward from
one of the gates; these, too, are mourners, and they
seem to be touched with even deeper grief. They
are carrying a dozen singed cats to the place for
solemn embalming, previous to interment, with sacred
rites. These animals had been their peculiar household
gods, and were kept in a sacred edifice, well
fed and carefully tended; but the building took fire,
on which the alarmed worshippers rushed into the
flames, regardless of themselves, and desirous only
of extricating their gods. But the bewildered animals
in their fright escaped back to the fire, and
numbers were burnt to death; and the procession is
now carrying their bodies to be embalmed. And
there is another procession passing onward along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the streets; they carry in solemn state a dog, their
god, now dead, and which they are transporting to
the place for sacred washing, preparatory to its removal
in state to the city of Busiris for interment.
Here, from out the water gate, comes another crowd
in the habiliments of woe, and with sounds of grief.
They are transporting, perhaps, a great benefactor to
their city, some one whose bounties have flowed
largely upon the poor, for such the mourners seem
to be? No&mdash;these are two companies, one carrying
a dead shrew-mouse, and the other a dead hawk, to
the place of sacred burial. But see, here comes a
couple of hogs, hooted at and bewildered; and mark
the alarm of the mourners as the animals become
entangled among their ranks; and see how they
rush to the river, and with their clothes on, plunge
in to cleanse their souls from the pollution caused
by the swinish contact.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Ancient Memphis! our spell has been too potent,
and wrought too effectually for the safety of our
enthusiasm; and so we bid thee good night. Thou
art well where thou art&mdash;laid low in the dust and
almost forgotten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Cross to Boulac. Splendid hospitality of the government. Our
cavalcade. Kindness of Mr. Gliddon. Description of his house.
The Baldac.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th, the U. S. Consul at
Cairo, Mr. Gliddon, Jun., came over, and our boats
were soon after removed to the opposite side of the
river. And here commenced a series of hospitable
attentions on the part of the government, which contributed
most materially to our comfort during the
time that we remained at Cairo. On the bank we
found waiting a European-built carriage, with four
white horses, for the ladies; and for each of the officers
a superb horse, with saddles of purple or black
silk velvet, richly embroidered in gold, and with
housings to correspond. Each horse had a groom,
who kept constantly in attendance. These were all
furnished from the Pasha’s stables in obedience to
orders from Alexandria, and each morning, during
our stay in the city, were brought to our house, and
also during the day whenever we required them.
The Commodore’s horse was a spirited charger from
Tyre, the saddle and housings of purple velvet embroidered
in gold, and stirrups of massive silver.
About thirty of these were paraded on the bank at
our landing; we looked at their flashing eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
their powerful frame as they pawed the earth, with
certain misgivings with regard to ourselves; but
concealing these as well as we could, with the help
of the grooms we soon found ourselves in the saddles;
and then, having for a while measured with our eyes
the distance between us and the ground, we turned
to look at our cavalcade. It was a very pretty sight;
and as we rode on, the natives stopped to gaze at us
with that look of wonder and admiration which is
so agreeable to a good horseman. The horses, after
all, though spirited, were easily managed; and, except
a bad habit of using their hinder legs against
their neighbor’s legs or bodies, were generally peaceable
enough. They are taught a singular gait when
in rapid motion, which to the natives may seem
admirable, but to us was any thing but agreeable; it is
as if the animal were to leap up with the whole four
feet at once.</p>

<p>Preceded by a Master of Horse, and accompanied by
two Chaouishes and five Cavasses, with the grooms,
each in the fanciful eastern costume, we wound onward
through the streets of Boulac, and, on looking
around, felt pleased each with himself, with his
horse, and with the world. The suburbs of Boulac
and Cairo straggle off so near to each other
as to leave but a short interval between; but there
is little of note on the way, except the garden where
Kleber was basely assassinated. It is elevated above,
and faces an open area or parade ground, which we
crossed just before entering the gates of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>After winding through a great labyrinth of streets,
we drew up at length before the house of Mr. Gliddon,
Jun. How greatly are we all indebted to the
hospitality and the very kind attentions of this gentleman.
As soon as he had learnt we were coming,
he sent down his large boat for the Commodore and
family, and it had reached Atf only an hour after
our departure: he now had broken up his bachelor
establishment, and threw open his house to us. He
planned our visits so that each day brought with it
some object of pleasing and useful curiosity; and
when our excursions were distant, took upon himself
all the trouble of preparation for them. We thanked
him warmly at parting, but our hearts continue to
thank him more warmly than words can do.</p>

<p>We entered his mansion, and freely took possession
of what had been so freely and kindly offered,
and then prevailed on Mr. Gliddon to become our
guest.</p>

<p>While resting here, I will briefly describe the mansion,
as it is a good specimen of the better kind of
houses in Cairo. Entering from the street, we found
ourselves in a passage with seats on either side, a
stopping-place for attendants, porter, or servants, who
may come on business. This opened into one angle
of a court, enclosed on three sides by the house; and
on the fourth by a wall separating it from an outer
yard or garden. Turning here to the left, we came
presently to a stairway leading to the second story of
the edifice. The lower part is occupied by servants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and as store rooms or for similar purposes. At the head
of the stairs on the right was a chamber opening
into the kitchen and its offices, and on the left a vestibule
conducting to the dining-room, a lofty and very
airy apartment. The walls and ceiling were ornamented
with a variety of carved work in wood, and for
windows were lattices in a great variety of handsome
patterns: at one side of the room were two large recesses,
adjoining projecting lattices; the floors in these
were raised about two feet, and furnished with carpets
and cushions. And here, after dinner, our company
retired to enjoy their Turkish pipes. Ascending to
the third story, and turning to the end of the building
opposite the dining-room, we came first to a vestibule,
the most striking object in which is several mammoth
jars of earthenware, filled with Nile water.
Through this vestibule we are admitted into the principal
apartment of the house. It is about fifty feet
in length, and airy and lofty; and raising our eyes to
the ceiling, we have here explained to us an object
which is apt to puzzle a traveller on his first approach
to an Egyptian city. He sees on each of the flat
roofs of the town before him something like a low
shed, closed at the sides but open in front, and with a
very long slanting roof. Here we discover its use,
for the elevated ceiling of this room, instead of being
flat throughout, towards one end begins to ascend, and
rising high above the roof of the house, a large opening
is thus made for the admission of air from above.
This opening is covered with fanciful lattice-work.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Its utility must be evident in a city where the houses
are three or four stories high, and the streets usually
not more than four feet in width. Entering this long
room, the visitor finds each end of it occupied by a
platform about a foot in height, covered with Turkey
carpets, and lined with broad, luxurious ottomans.
These platforms are separated at the centre of the room
by a strip of marble pavement about twelve feet wide;
at one end of which, opposite to us as we enter, is a recess
with marble shelves for confectionary, pipes, and
for supporting the priceless and most tempting Baldac.
The Baldac, the reader, after this encomium,
will be surprised to hear is only an earthen drinking
vessel, in shape of a Florence flask, though about
three times as large; it is unglazed, and the water
oozing through its thin sides, evaporates, and produces
a delicious coolness. I do not know any piece of
furniture that, if taken from the inhabitants, would
be so much regretted as the Baldac. Each one, as he
needs, drinks at once from the Baldac, five or six of
them being always kept ready for use. Water for the
whole city is brought from the Nile on the backs of
camels or mules.</p>

<p>We return to our description of the house, which,
however, is nearly completed. The remainder of the
third tier is appropriated to sleeping apartments, and a
fourth range over them is devoted to a similar purpose.
The roof is flat, but irregular. Nearly all the
windows in this building look into the court: but in
most of the buildings there are latticed windows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
looking into the narrow streets; sometimes they project
a little, so as to give the fair inmates an opportunity
of seeing all that is passing below, without being
seen themselves. Occasionally we catch a glimpse
of a dark eye or a jewelled hand, through the openings
of the fanciful but jealous lattice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Visit to the Governor of Cairo. Court of the Mamelukes. Their
massacre. Schools in the Citadel. Court of Justice. Palace of
the Pasha. View from it. The “City of Tombs.” A human
monster. Plain of Memphis. Heliopolis. Mosque of the
bloody baptism. Joseph’s Well. Mint. Manufactory of Arms.
The Citadel. “The Lions.”</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 21st we found the
grooms with our horses in the court below, and after
breakfast mounted for a visit of ceremony to the Abdi
Effendi, the governor of the city. The carriage was
waiting in an adjoining bazaar, where it had been compelled
to stop by the narrowness of the streets; and
here our cavalcade was formed in the following order:
1. Two Cavasses; 2. The carriage; 3. Eight
Cavasses; 4. Two Chaouishes; 5. A Master of the
Horse; 6. Dragoman; next the Commodore and
Consul, and after them the remaining officers of the
party. Having traversed the whole length of the
city, we began, near its southern outskirts, to ascend,
and presently found ourselves before the frowning
walls of the citadel of Cairo. Here, in this strong
eyrie, well guarded both by nature and art, the Pasha
of Egypt has built his palace, and gathered his treasures,
and formed his arsenal for arms. The citadel
stands on a spur from the range of Kebel Mokattam,
the mountains that, stretching along on the East, help
to form the valley of the Nile. Here they make a bend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and stretch off far to the eastward; and at the angle,
on an irregular platform thrown off from it, the citadel
was built, or at least enlarged to its present dimensions,
in the 12th century, by the famous Saladin.
It is a place of great strength, and may be considered
as the key of all the upper parts of Egypt. On
passing the heavy exterior gateway, we found ourselves
in the court, where, twenty-five years ago, by
order of Mohammed Ali, was perpetrated the bloody
massacre of the Mamelukes. It is of irregular shape,
with high walls on one side, and on the others
steep ascents or precipices, surmounted by ramparts,
above which again are heavy buildings, and among
them the ruins of Saladin’s palace. It was a place
well chosen for such a butchery, and the whole
plan of operations was strikingly characteristic of the
man.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, be recollected by the reader that the
Mamelukes, as a distinct body, owed their origin to
Saladin, who, distrusting his native troops, formed
a body-guard of slaves, procured by purchase or capture
from the countries bordering on the Caspian.
They rose gradually under successive sultans, and
all the fortresses at length being trusted to them,
they concluded to turn the power to their own use, and
through their Beys became the governors of Egypt.
Various, after this, were their changes of fortune;
the hardy soldiers, being generally successful in
the field, but circumvented by their cunning adversaries
in the council-room. The French found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in them most obstinate and determined opposers; and
when, at the close of this war, the British arms were
triumphant, Lord Hutchinson demanded of the Sultan
of Constantinople, to whom the country was
yielded, the restitution of the Mamelukes to their former
privileges. He promised compliance, but had
determined on the extinction of this race of dangerous
subjects. The Turkish admiral, who was sent
for this purpose, first enticed a great number of them
to a pleasure excursion in boats off Aboukir, and his
ships opening fire upon them, the greater portion were
destroyed. War with their race being thus declared,
Mohammed Ali, then first rising into notice, was sent
with a force against them, but was defeated and
compelled to retreat. This was the origin of the
inveteracy of Mohammed Ali towards the Mamelukes.</p>

<p>On the invasion of Egypt by the English in
1807, the Beys united with the rising Pasha; but
it was only a momentary truce; and the defeat
of the English, giving him secure possession of
Egypt, sealed at the same time the fate of his too
trustful allies. He immediately formed a plan for
the total destruction of the Mamelukes. His son
Tousson was about this time preparing to lead an
army against the Wahabees, and as this was a religious
war, it was determined to invest him with the
command under circumstances of unusual splendor.
The Mameluke Beys were invited to the ceremony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
which was to commence in the citadel. They came,
led by their chief, Chahyn Bey; and a more splendid
cavalcade never filed in through the portals of this
fortress. They amounted to 470 men, on horseback,
together with about an equal number of attendants
of the same race on foot. Their reception
was flattering. The Pasha addressed them individually,
and with a bland aspect and smiles, welcomed
them to the festivities. At length it was necessary
to form a procession, and the Mamelukes were
honored by being put in a body near the head of it:
they filed down and entered this rocky court; but
when their whole body had gained it, the gates were
suddenly shut both in front and rear, and they found
themselves cruelly entrapped. The heights above
were in a moment covered with the Pasha’s soldiers,
and a deadly fire was poured down on them. Rage
and execration were in vain: they were coolly shot
down till not an individual remained alive. One of
the Beys escaped by spurring his horse up the steep
outer wall; in the descent the animal was dashed to
pieces, but the rider was unhurt.</p>

<p>This was the end of the Mamelukes. On the
following day the soldiers rushed into the city, and
under pretext of searching for more victims, plundered
a large part of it before the Pasha and his son
durst venture out to repress their fury.</p>

<p>Our horses, on reaching this bloody court, seemed
themselves to be seized with the very spirit of violence;
for pricking their ears, they rushed up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
steep ascent with headlong speed, and, whirling
through Saladin’s court, and then through a larger
one, brought us up at length in front of the governor’s
palace. It is a long building and spacious, but
is otherwise by no means remarkable. Abdi Effendi
has been in England and France, and speaks the
language of the latter country fluently. He received
us with great politeness, and entertained us with the
usual eastern hospitalities. His questions with regard
to our own country were pertinent, and evinced
a good knowledge of its laws and institutions. He
spoke in terms of high admiration of his own sovereign;
and indeed Mohammed Ali seems to have
the faculty of creating a strong attachment for himself
in all his officers. The governor said that if the
Pasha could live twenty years longer, he would make
Egypt more civilized and more prosperous than it
has ever yet been; but added, that he stood all alone,
and greatly needed some one who could be a second
self to him.</p>

<p>From the audience-hall we were taken to visit a
number of schools in the same building; they occupy
a number of rooms, and contained altogether
four hundred youths, preparing for public employments
in the country. As far as I could judge,
they seemed to be awkwardly conducted. At the
extreme end of the building we came to the Hall of
Justice, where, on an ottoman and all alone, sat the
judge, a man of prodigious corporeal dimensions.
He was at this time unemployed, but our attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was drawn to a new mat with which the floor was
covered. It had just been put down in place of one
that, a few days before, had been worn through by
the writhings of a poor wretch, who had been bastinadoed
here; the punishment having followed close
on the heels, if not of justice, at least of the
culprit.</p>

<p>The adjoining side of the court into which this
palace looks, is formed by a large palace of Mohammed
Ali, to which, in the course of sight-seeing, we
were next conducted. It is quite new, and in some
parts not quite finished; and is more remarkable for
the airy and spacious character of the rooms than
for any beauties of architecture. Indeed, all the
palaces which we visited in Egypt, though cool
and spacious, are marked by great simplicity. A
hall of great width passes across at the centre of the
building, and is intersected by another of somewhat
narrower dimensions, running lengthwise; and thus
at each angle a chamber is formed. These chambers
are carpeted, and have the most luxurious ottomans
passing quite around. These, with sometimes
a glass lustre suspended from the lofty ceiling, constitute
the only furniture. In the palace, which we
were now visiting, the ottomans were covered with
the richest French silks, with raised figures in beautiful
patterns worked on them. In front of the
seats hung down an impenetrable veil of silken
tassels.</p>

<p>And now let us rest ourselves for a while on these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
tempting seats, here by these lofty windows, from
which we may look down over all the wide-spread
landscape. The ladies of the Commodore’s family
have gone to visit the Sultana, and it will be some
time before they return; and a better place for a view
over all the city and the country beyond, we could
not desire. The palace is built on the highest part
of the citadel, and enjoys, indeed, a very extensive
prospect, and even at this sultry hour we are here
fanned by a delightful breeze.</p>

<p>There, look below where the mountains of Mokattam
turn off towards the east, you see between them
and the city a great number of buildings of remarkable
and light Saracenic architecture, standing alone
on the sandy waste. This is “The city of Tombs;”
the burying-place of the nobles of modern Cairo.
Many of these edifices, consisting, as you perceive,
of domes supported, by tall slender columns, are the
tombs of the Mamelukes when their race was in power;
but there you observe one larger than all the rest, surmounted
by three domes, and remarkable for its light
but rich style of architecture; that is the Mausoleum
belonging to the family of Mohammed Ali. Its
three chambers are enriched with tombs of Italian
marble, and their marble floors are covered with
Persian or Turkey carpets. Some of his wives and
two of his children are buried here; and every Friday
(the Moslem sabbath) their tombs are covered with
Cashmere shawls. Here lies also buried the infant
daughter of Ibrahim Pasha, taken off in innocent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
childhood; and close by is the recently interred body
of Defterden Bey, a very tiger in cruelty, and as
vile a monster as has ever lived. He was sent to
this country when it was still subject to the Sultan,
to watch the Pasha and collect the revenue of his
master at Constantinople: but it is supposed that a
large part of it went no further than his own pockets;
for in a short time he grew immensely rich. He
was, indeed, at length inferior in wealth only to the
Pasha himself. He owned the garden in which the
brave Kleber was assassinated. He was often in
power; and his favorite mode of punishment was to
bury the criminal up to his neck in quick-lime, and
thus leave him to perish. On one occasion, his farrier
having neglected to shoe a favorite horse according
to his directions, he ordered the shoes to be
nailed to the feet of the smith himself. The man
died in a few hours in the greatest agonies.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when the Pasha’s son
Ishmael had been treacherously burnt in his tent in
upper Egypt, Defterden Bey was sent to examine
into the affair and punish the culprits. He called
the inhabitants of the district together, to the number
of 10,000, and in revenge burnt them all to
death, including women and children; and then
plundered the country.</p>

<p>He kept a pet lion, which by some means or other
he had attached or awed into gentleness to himself;
and one of his amusements consisted in throwing
meat to the animal, and then ordering his attendants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to take it away; on which the animal often flew at
them and tore them to pieces.</p>

<p>This is only a portion of the inhuman acts, of
which he was guilty; but, the earth at last grew
weary of the monster; and his royal master seems to
have grown weary of him also; for one day, after
drinking coffee with the Pasha, he went home, was
immediately taken sick, and died. Mohammed Ali
seized on his immense property, and then honored
the body by a burial place in his own tomb.</p>

<p>But observe now that river, how peacefully it
glides along, unceasing in its flow, and ever distributing
comfort and happiness to the dense population
along its banks. Such are Heaven’s dealings to
us. What a contrast to this has ever been presented
here in men’s dealings towards each other. Say, is
man still in the image of his maker?</p>

<p>Our eyes glance on the other side of the river,
over the site of Memphis. The western mountains
there recede about eight miles from the stream,
and it is supposed that the whole of this was covered
by its magnificent temples and its dwellings; now
the very site of it is disputed by some persons; at
all events its ruin is so complete, that objects can no
longer be distinguished. Just below it is the Plain
of Mummies, still tenanted, as it has been for ages,
by forms of human beings that move not and speak
not. Men there are at peace with each other. Over
this well-peopled but silent city of the dead, we see
the small Pyramids of Sakhara: and further down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
at a distance of six or eight miles, arise the stupendous
structures, the Pyramids of Ghizeh. I have
never looked at them without a feeling of awe.</p>

<p>Between us and them, on the western bank of the
river, is the little village of Ghizeh, from which they
take their modern name; and still nearer to us, on
the eastern bank, is the village of Old Cairo, now
worthy of note only as the port for boats from upper
Egypt. Between it and the larger city of its name
you are noticing some hillocks, that seem remarkable
objects on this level plain. They are composed
of pottery and other rubbish from the city; and your
memory will supply you with another example of
such hillocks in the neighborhood of Rome. In the
latter city the merchants have dug into the base,
and formed wine-cellars, which are said to answer
admirably well. Near these of old Cairo is also an
ancient aqueduct, a fine looking object on the landscape,
but useless, as it is now in ruins.</p>

<p>And now look directly north, about eight miles,
and you see&mdash;no, you cannot see a solitary pillar
standing on the open and deserted plain. There is
not even a vestige of a ruin near it; and yet there
stood in ancient times the great and the learned, as
well as the splendid, city of Heliopolis, or “The City
of the Sun.” It was of vast extent, and had many
large temples; among them one dedicated to the sun,
with a mirror so disposed as, during the whole day,
to reflect the rays of that luminary into the body of
the edifice. Thither came the scholars of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
times to drink from the streams of knowledge;
there Herodotus acquired his lore; and, above all,
there Plato studied; and there, too, it is supposed
that Moses “was taught in all the learning of the
Egyptians.” But neither grandeur nor knowledge
itself could avail to save it; and of its many splendid
structures, but a single column remains to mark
its site.</p>

<p>But here at our feet is Cairo, teeming with life,
and with the human passions all at work; and yet
it seems like a city of the dead. We hear no
sound, no cry; life seems to be stagnant there; but
it is not. The surface is not greatly ruffled, but
beneath it the passions are fermenting: who shall
follow them in their various changes and their devious
windings? But we will not philosophise. Here,
just below us, is the mosque of Sultan Hassan; and,
as our time is short, we will hasten to occupy ourselves
with its singular history; a history that has
a strong dash of the Arabian Nights, and yet is
solemn truth, that may be told in open day. This
is the largest, and in its architecture the most imposing
mosque in Cairo. It is massy, and ornamented
with heavy mouldings; and though of the Saracenic
style, is a solid and substantial building. And now
for its history.</p>

<p>About two centuries ago lived Sultan Hassan, a
sovereign prosperous and beloved, but withal somewhat
eccentric. He had every thing to make him
contented, but there rose up in him, by and by, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
strong desire to travel. He longed to see foreign
lands; to study the living world; to hear the sages
of other climes; and, if possible, to turn philosopher
himself. The royalty that acted as a barrier
to the gratification of his wishes, became at length
odious to him, and he determined for a while to lay
it aside, and to travel as a private individual. He sent,
therefore, for his prime minister or Vizier, and after a
confidential interview, delivered to him in trust, during
the sovereign’s absence, the sceptre of honor
and the throne of state. He himself left the kingdom,
and all traces of him were speedily lost. He now
assumed the appearance of a merchant, and under this
character travelled through many and far distant lands.
He went wherever curiosity enticed him, toiling on from
place to place, in hopes that at each it would still its
unquiet yearnings and be satisfied; he studied man
in every variety of character; he conversed with
the wise men of every country, and at length he
became a wise man himself, which was evinced by
a resolution to return forthwith and be contented at
home. Curiosity, he found, only gathered strength
by each gratification; the world and its notions were a
greater puzzle to him than at the beginning; and what
little he knew of them, made him afraid to examine
further; and as to wisdom itself, he found it every
where less valued than money, and was astonished to
see even himself, by and by, deserting the pursuit of it
for the pursuit of wealth. He was rapidly successful
in his dealings, and grew very rich; and now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ending where he had begun in his boyhood, with
believing that Egypt was the best and happiest
country in the world, he set out forthwith on his
return.</p>

<p>But a disappointment awaited him. His faithless
Vizier, concluding that the power which he found
so agreeable for a short time, would be agreeable
through life, had established himself firmly on the
throne; and the old Sultan, on reaching the confines
of his country, found that the very name of Hassan
had been interdicted to his people, and that he was
apparently forgotten. He kept his disguise, and, safe
in the changes which time and exposure, and a long
beard had wrought on his face, he travelled on, and
found himself at length once more in Cairo. The
wealthy merchant soon had many friends, and his
business continuing to prosper, he applied by and
by for permission to erect a mosque, as an act of
thanksgiving to Allah for his numerous favors. The
request was granted, and the foundations of this
mosque, closely adjoining the citadel, were laid with
the usual ceremonies. Under pretext of strengthening
the edifice in so unstable a soil, he laid the
groundwork strong and deep, and secured it moreover
with numerous arches or vaults. The building
rose, and the populace came in multitudes to look at
the huge edifice and praise the piety of the liberal-handed
merchant, who before long found that he
had established a throne, at least in the hearts of the
people. He was aiming, however, at a more substantial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
throne. He had by this time filled the deep
vaults with men, whom by liberal pay he had engaged
to wait there for his bidding, and whom he
daily practised with the scimitar, till there was not
one among them who could not at a blow sever
without disarranging the light tuft of down, the acme
of a Turkish swordsman’s ambition. The edifice
was finished, and a grand building, as you perceive,
it really is; and the new courtiers, in their way back
and forth between the palace and the city, stopped to
applaud the zeal of the pious merchant; nor dreamed
for a moment of the pandemonium beneath. It is
customary when a mosque is consecrated to give it
also a name; and this having now been finished, a
day was appointed for these ceremonies; and as the
edifice was so highly ornamental to the city, the
Sultan himself consented to grace the occasion with
his presence. He came with a great retinue of courtiers
and a line of guards; and splendid indeed was
the scene within the proud and stately edifice. The
merchant himself was placed in a conspicuous and
an honorable station. The ceremony commenced,
and the prayers were said; and the Mufti at length,
turning to the merchant, bade him pronounce the
name by which his pious offering to Allah should be
known. He rose from his seat, and while all leaned
forward to catch the sound, he replied, “Call it Sultan
Hassan.” The multitude started as if each had
been bitten by a serpent, and the Mufti grew pale;
but recovering himself, demanded if he had heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
him aright. “Yes,” he cried, as a curtain rose at one
end and disclosed the name in large letters of gold:
“call it by my name, by that of your sovereign,
Sultan Hassan;” and at the words, his myrmidons,
who had been led up from the vaults and distributed
through the church, falling on the astonished usurper
and his train, put them all to the sword. From
thence they rushed to the citadel, of which they got
possession; and before the sun went down, Sultan
Hassan was once more proclaimed sovereign of
Egypt.</p>

<p>Such was the history of this building, as it was
narrated to us on the spot. One of the Cavasses offered
to show me the interior if I would disguise
myself like a Turk; but as I felt no disposition to put
my own neck to hazard in this mosque of the bloody
baptism, I satisfied myself with looking at the
outer walls.</p>

<p>Close adjoining it are some lions, however, which
are worthy of a visit. They are just from the deserts,
and are very different from the abused and
broken-spirited animals exhibited in our country and
in Europe. They are confined in a room of no
great dimensions, and are fastened only by a chain
attached to the wall; and if any man, who calls himself
one of the lords of creation, would meditate on
the justice of his vaunted title, I would advise him
to go and do it in this den of lions.</p>

<p>The ladies of our party returned, after an absence
of about an hour, greatly delighted with their visit;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they were, I believe, the first foreign ladies ever permitted
to enter this part of the palace, and were allowed
to depart only on the promise of a longer visit
as soon as circumstances would admit.</p>

<p>From the Pasha’s palace we proceeded to visit
“Joseph’s Well,” a deep pit for supplying the citadel
with water, dug, however, not by the Joseph of
our Scriptures, but by Saladin, whose name, I believe,
was also Yousef or Joseph. It consists of
two shafts, the upper about 150 feet in depth and 45
in diameter, with a winding gallery around, separated
from the shaft by a wall pierced with openings
for the admission of light. This is all cut out of the
solid rock. The lower shaft is about 120 feet in depth,
making altogether 270 feet. The water is raised
to the top of the first shaft by means of oxen, and
poured into a reservoir, whence it is carried up in a
similar manner to a reservoir in the citadel; but it
is brackish, and used for drinking only in times of
siege.</p>

<p>Mounting our horses once more, we returned
through the court of the Mamelukes, and at its further
extremity, within the citadel, alighted to examine
an extensive manufactory of fire-arms. They first
took us to a foundry of brass cannon in active operation,
and thence to a suite of rooms where some
hundreds of native workmen were employed manufacturing
muskets, pistols, swords, and gun-carriages,
&amp;c., in rolling sheet copper for the navy, and in
making bolts and sheathing nails. They manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
here 36,000 muskets annually, with pistols and
sabres to correspond. The various parts of the musket
are made exactly of the same size, so that if any
part is injured, it can be immediately replaced. The
different branches are superintended by foreigners,
mostly from France; but the master workmen are
all natives of the country, many of them having been
sent abroad to qualify them for these stations.</p>

<p>The mint is also kept in the citadel, and on a subsequent
visit they took us over every part, explaining
the whole process of money-making, and striking for
us impressions on paper of all their coins. The machinery
is old and clumsy, but they had just imported
a new set made of cast iron from England, which
they were about putting into operation. We found
the superintendent of the mint, an old man with a
superb white beard, poring over a great atlas just
printed at Constantinople, and sadly puzzled with its
labyrinths. He seemed quite grateful for a little assistance
we were able to give him in comprehending
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Visit to the Cotton factories. Iron foundries. Palace of Ibrahim
Pasha. English garden on an island in the Nile. Stables of
Ibrahim Pasha. Arabian horses. Bazaars. Slave market.
Madhouse. The maniac butcher.</p>

<p>The Egyptian monarch is fond of having his improvements
inspected by foreigners, and our own inclinations
being in no wise averse to this, we gave
the 22d to an examination of a variety of objects
of this kind bordering on the Nile. Leaving
the city by the Boulac gate, we turned soon after
down the avenue leading to Shubra, and, after, pursuing
it for a mile and a half, crossed some open
gardens, and were then shown into a large inclosure
containing the summer palace and grounds of a nephew
of Mohammed Ali, and one of the officers of his
court. It is a pretty place, and as the day was
growing hot, we particularly enjoyed a marble kiosk,
with fountains tossing their delicious waters into the
air. From this we proceeded to one of those large
edifices that in our moonlight sail up the river had
fixed themselves so strongly on our fancy; but in
the broad daylight, instead of a magnificent palace,
with a scene of Eastern enchantment spread all
around it, we found a steam cotton factory, puffing
and blowing, and sending jets of smoke from every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
one of its numerous tall chimnies. But as we all
called ourselves philanthropists, we considered
it, or tried to consider it, a very pleasing sight; and
our gratification was really great, as we proceeded
through the establishment and inspected its very
extensive operations. The principal building is for
spinning and weaving, and I counted here more
than one hundred looms of cast iron, just imported
from England; in this they were just putting into
operation a steam engine of twenty horse power, also
of English manufacture; the floor of the second
story in this edifice is supported by cast iron columns,
and every part is not only neat and convenient, but
also substantial. It is superintended by a Scottish
gentleman, Mr. Galloway. Attached to this is a
yard for bleaching, a machine manufactory, and a
long building for printing the cottons. The printing
is all done by blocks, both made and worked by the
natives, who in this business, we were informed,
show great aptitude and skill. The patterns, copied
mostly from the French, are handsome; and the colors
are said to be enduring. The price of labor here is
almost nothing, and the Egyptian Pasha has only to
persevere, in order to succeed in all the Eastern markets.
A difficulty presented itself in the expense of
fuel for his steam engines, but his enterprise seems
to be in a fair way to surmount even this. Some explorations
on Mount Lebanon, conducted by his orders,
have lately resulted in the discovery of a mine
of bituminous coal, at a place called Carnayl, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
western side of the mountain, about four miles from
the sea, and twelve northward from Beirout. Where
the stratum first presented itself, it was three feet three
inches in thickness, and the coal was too much mixed
with impurities to be fit for steam power; but when
we left Beirout, there were indications that it would
increase both in quantity and purity. Mr. Brattell,
an English gentleman employed by the Pasha in
these investigations, thinks there is coal also on the
eastern side of Mount Lebanon, and is sanguine also
in expectations of discovering lead and iron ores.
There can be no doubt that the latter is very abundant
in that mountain.</p>

<p>From the manufactory we returned to rest ourselves
in the cool kiosk, where we were hospitably
served also with fruits and other refreshments.</p>

<p>Returning from this along the banks of the river,
we were conducted, near the outskirts of Boulac, to
a large foundry for iron cannon and other castings;
it contains, I believe, three furnaces; but at midday
on the 22d of July, in Egypt, we felt little disposition
to be sticking our heads among iron furnaces;
and instead of this useful curiosity, hastened
to put all the Baldacs we could find in requisition,
declaring unanimously that we had never met with
any fluid so delicious as the water of the Nile. At
Boulac are also manufactories for cotton handkerchiefs,
and for clothing for the army and navy, as
well as store-houses filled with their productions,
which we were invited to visit; but the heat had become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
so oppressive, as to leave little disposition to
bodily effort, and, mounting our steeds, we passed
through Boulac, and hastened to deposite our persons
in the large and cool palace of Ibrahim Pasha.</p>

<p>This palace, quite a new building, is situated on
the outskirts of Old Cairo, about two miles above
Boulac, and a few hundred yards from the banks of
the river, from which it is separated by well-shaded
pleasure-grounds. The halls or passages by which
it is crossed in the manner already described, are
here unusually spacious; and the stairway being also
wide, it has an air not only of magnificence, but of
delicious coolness. In the Audience hall a fountain
gushes out of the wall, about six feet above the pavement,
and forming a succession of small cascades
at length reaches the floor, where it is received
into a large marble basin; from this it meanders in
a marble channel to the centre of the hall, and spreads
out into a small lake about three feet in depth.
Along the channel are numerous fish, sculptured in
marble, in various attitudes.</p>

<p>The usual hospitable refreshment of sherbet, pipes,
and coffee, was presented us here, and, seated on the
luxurious ottomans at the end of the longitudinal hall,
enveloped in odorous fumes, and listening to the
waterfall, or watching the natives, who, in their
picturesque costumes, were passing back or forward,
we spent the time till the heat of the day had passed.</p>

<p>About two hundred yards from this is the island
at the head of which, in an edifice erected for it, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
situated the celebrated Nilometer, or graduated column,
for measuring the depth of the river, and from
which report is made when the river has attained
an elevation sufficient to ensure a favorable season.
When this is done, the banks which restrain the
water from flowing into the canal leading to Cairo,
are cut down, the water flows in, floods the squares
of the city, and then ensues a season of hilarity and
merry-making throughout the whole city.</p>

<p>The island contains about seven or eight acres,
and, until lately, presented nothing remarkable; but
it is now a very fascinating spot. About four years
since, Mohammed Ali employed an English horticulturist,
Mr. Trail, to put it in order. He built a
stone wall around it, reaching from below low watermark,
to a height above the greatest elevation of the
floods, and had machinery constructed for irrigating
it by means of canals, at all seasons of the year. It
is laid out partly in regular plots, but chiefly in the
English garden style, with winding walks, serpentine
streams, lakes, grottoes, rustic bridges, glades, and
lawns; and, what in Egypt is rather curious, in one
place is ornamented with <em>artificial</em> ruins of temples
and similar objects. The size of the trees here are a
proof of the astonishing fecundity of the soil when
irrigation is well supplied; for, although the time
has been so short, the ground is covered with trees
thirty and forty feet in height; the shrubbery is luxuriant,
and embosoms many delicious retreats from
the sultry sun. They have collected here all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
plants natural to the country, together with many of
foreign origin. Egypt, however, does not produce a
great variety of flowers or useful shrubs. Mr. Trail
has a house at one side of the garden, in which we
were hospitably entertained.</p>

<p>On returning to the palace some of our party
returned home, while the rest of us proceeded to
visit the stables of Ibrahim Pasha. This warrior
chief is a great lover of horses; and in the course
of his expeditions into Syria and Arabia, has had the
best opportunities of making a collection; and he
appears to have profited by them.</p>

<p>The Master of Horse, who came to receive us,
informed us that the whole collection amounts to
eight hundred, among which are many of pure
Arabian blood; but that the best were either out at
pasture, or with the Pasha’s army in Syria. At our
visit there were about four hundred animals of various
breeds in the stables; and on entering we were
presented with a spectacle of ferocity bordering on
the terribly sublime. Whether it is a matter of
instinct or education I cannot say, but they no
sooner caught sight of our foreign dress, and heard our
language, than each animal seemed changed into a
fury; their eyes flashed, their manes seemed to rise,
they kicked, and writhed, and tried every means to
break loose; snorting, and showing in every part of
their distorted features the most savage rage. Their
keepers went among them, and succeeded in establishing
a little more quiet; but it was really curious to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
see the malice which they seemed to bear towards
us to the last.</p>

<p>Among them were eight full blooded Arabs of a
superior breed; and I suppose I shall suffer in the
opinion of all amateurs of horses, when I say that I
was disappointed in them. Their limbs are well
formed for activity, but their necks appeared to me
too short and heavy for the highest kind of beauty;
but I will add that I am no great judge of such matters,
and ought to offer an opinion with diffidence.
We saw here the horse that had carried Ibrahim in
all his wars with the Wahabees; it is a gray, and is
a handsome animal; but is now thirty years old,
and, though well fed and kindly treated, is never
used. There were one or two others in the collection
similarly situated; one I noticed, so old as to
be scarcely able to stand, and the picture of decrepitude.
Some horses from Dongola, in Upper Egypt,
were striking animals; they were large and very
powerful, with glossy coats of pure jet black. The
Arabians were of various colors: white, bay, and
brown. Among them were numerous colts and
some mules; we saw also a donkey, of a white
color, for which the Pasha had been offered $600.
It was the largest animal of this description that I
have ever seen. A mule by an Arab mare was
also a beautiful object, it had legs like those of an
antelope, and an eye of fire. They informed us
that two strong men were required to manage it.</p>

<p>July 23d. Most of this day was spent in lounging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
among the bazaars. Some of these are wide,
and the roof or covering being elevated to a height
of forty or fifty feet, they are not only airy, but the
effect on the eye is good; but most of them are
not at all remarkable, while the generality of the
streets in Cairo are, I think, narrower than usual,
even in Turkish cities. Provisions are abundant in
them, and very cheap. Passing one day along the
bazaars, we turned into a court adjoining them to
take a look at the depository and market for slaves.
The court is not large, but is surrounded with
houses of irregular shape, swarming with slaves,
tier back of tier, as far as our eyes could reach.
They were all of a jet black, with smooth glossy
skins; and the hair of the females was worked up
by a greasy substance into long ringlets, which fell
on either side of the head. Their cheeks were in
some instances marked by scars in regular figures,
evidently designed to be an addition to their charms.
As we passed among them, they put on their best
looks, and by smiles and gestures invited us to
become their purchasers; to which, I believe, we felt
not the least inclined, though their price was
extremely low.</p>

<p>Taking a Cavass on another occasion, I went off
to visit the madhouse, of which I had heard some
singular accounts. After threading a great labyrinth
of streets, he told me that we were approaching it,
and that it would be necessary for him to take them
some provisions as a kind of admittance fee. So I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
furnished him with money, and he filled his arms
with the cakes, somewhat like a thick pancake,
which are the common food of the lower classes in
Cairo. On this introduction the keeper admitted us,
and I found myself in an open square or court, surrounded
by a stone edifice in which were the cells
of the maniacs. It was a sight not only mortifying
to the pride of man, but adapted to harrow up all his
feelings of sympathy. The cells were not more than
seven or eight feet square, with uneven floors of
stone or earth, and were grated on the side towards
the court. Their inmates were sometimes fastened
with chains, but sometimes at liberty to make the
most of the narrow precincts of their cells. They
were quite in a state of nature, filthy, and often
covered with sores; and seemed, poor creatures, to be
badly fed. On seeing the cakes, their countenances
brightened; they stretched out their emaciated arms
between the iron bars, and on being supplied, began
to devour rather than eat, till in a short time our
supply was exhausted. I turned, saddened and sickened,
from the sight.</p>

<p>A short time before our visit, a butcher was brought
and shut up here in a state of complete and dangerous
madness. After some time he grew more gentle,
and by and by was sometimes permitted by the
keeper to leave his cell and to go at large through the
court. One morning the latter, on returning to his
duty, was met at the gate by this man, with an expression
of joy on his face, and invited to come in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and make a purchase of his meat, which he said he
could highly recommend. The keeper, on entering,
found, to his surprise, in one corner of the court a rude
imitation of shambles, well furnished with meat cut up
in a variety of forms. He gazed with astonishment,
and a horrible idea now suddenly crossing his mind,
he began a hasty examination of the cells. He was
right. The half-starved wretch had murdered one
of the other maniacs, and dragged the body piecemeal
through the bars; and it was the dismembered
carcass of his comrade that was suspended on the
shambles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Preparations to visit the Pyramids. Audience of leave with the
Governor of Cairo. Visit of the ladies of our party to the Sultana.
Description of the Harem.</p>

<p>The 24th was a day of bustle, a large portion
of it being spent at home, superintending the storing
of wines and fruits, the cooking of fowls and
eggs, and the preparation of all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et ceteras</i> that
would be required by a few days’ residence on the
desert.</p>

<p>The plan, as formed by our good friend, Mr. Gliddon,
was to make an early start on the morrow, to
the great Pyramids of Ghizeh, thence proceed to the
Pyramids of Sakhara, sleep in tents in their neighborhood;
on the following morning examine the site
of Memphis, and then going on board his boat, which
would be directed to meet us there, to drop down the
river, stopping by the way at the military and naval
school at Toura.</p>

<p>As it was the Commodore’s intention, after this
excursion, to start immediately on his return to
the ship, he had sent on the 23d, to the governor of
Cairo, to say that he would this day have an audience
of leave; and the ladies of his family also had
despatched a messenger to the Sultana, stating that
they would make the visit which, on the previous
occasion, they had promised her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, at 9 A. M. the party proceeded to
the citadel in the same order as before, where
the officers were received by the governor in a larger
and more magnificent hall than at the former visit.
While the usual compliments of pipes, coffee, and
sherbet were offered, the Commodore made the governor
his acknowledgments “for the honor and
great attention shown him as an American officer,
and to the officers with him; stating that their civilities
had left us nothing to desire, and that, individually,
he felt under great obligations to his Excellency
the Pasha, a lively remembrance of whose
kindness he should ever retain.” To this the governor
replied, that he acted only according to his instructions,
and was happy in being the instrument of
carrying them into effect; the American commander
was considered the guest of the Pasha, who, if he
had been present, would have been able to do more,
and would doubtless have ordered a palace for our
accommodation. To this there was added much on
both sides that was complimentary, if that can be
called compliment on our part, which proceeded from
real admiration and truly grateful feeling.</p>

<p>From the governor’s hall, the party retired to the
palace of Mohammed Ali, and were again served
with coffee, &amp;c.; the mouth-pieces of the pipes served
on this occasion being richly set with diamonds; the
coffee cups were set in fillagree work of gold, enriched
also with the same precious stones. Some
hours were spent in smoking, and in visiting the interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
objects in and about the citadel not seen
before; while, in the mean time, the ladies of the
Commodore’s family were making their visit to
those of the Harem.</p>

<p>I am allowed to insert here an account of this
visit from a letter, written without the least idea of
publication, but which places before us, in graphic
language, scenes which strangers were never before
allowed to witness. Our interest in reading it takes
a melancholy character from the reflection that the
accomplished youthful writer is now an inmate of
the tomb.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“We are the only Christians who have ever been
admitted into the Pasha’s Harem. We were there
twice. The first time was a mere visit, but the second
was to spend the day. I must endeavor to describe
it for you. At the gate we were received by
a dozen male attendants, who led us to the garden
gate, where we found three girls playing upon different
Arab instruments, while two others were singing
and two dancing, magnificently dressed in crimson
and blue cloth, embroidered in gold&mdash;the full pantaloons
hanging over the foot, just allowing an embroidered
slipper to be seen&mdash;a jacket, tight to the
shape, without sleeves, open a little upon the chest,
where appeared a chemise of blue or white gauze,
closely spangled, sleeves of the same, hanging large
and full to the elbow, and down behind in a dozen
plaits; and on the side and top of the head, large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sprigs of diamonds. A sash of gold tissue, with a
deep gold fringe, finished the dress. These pretty
creatures preceded us to the palace door, where we
were met like old friends by the Sultana, her maids
of honor and attendants, to the number of a hundred
at least. The great hall of state into which we were
ushered, was an immense one, lined and floored with
white marble; in the centre a basin fifteen feet
square, and a large fountain, from which the clearest
water was playing; the ceiling richly painted and
gilt; one side of the hall lined with ottomans of
white silk, embroidered in gold, and a beautiful Persian
carpet spread in front of them. As soon as we
were seated, coffee and pipes were handed to us.
The Sultana is about 35 years old, with a fine face,
though the eye is stern&mdash;dignified and affable in her
manners. Her dress was a chali, made in Turkish
style, only more closed over the neck. On the head
was a sort of skull cap, formed entirely of diamonds.
Around this was twisted an embroidered kerchief,
and on the left side, down near the ear, was placed a
sprig of flowers, made of enormous diamonds: earrings,
a single pair, shaped like a drop, as large as
the end of my little finger, and on her little finger
was a most superb diamond ring. Around us stood
the hundred attendants, dressed in colored silks; and
every one, even of the lowest rank, with heads covered
with diamonds. The pipe stems and sockets
of the coffee cups were also covered with these precious
stones. Such a glitter I never saw before. An<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Armenian woman, who spoke Italian, was there as
our interpretess. Our gloves and buckles excited
their admiration, indeed our whole dress. I don’t
know that I was ever so hauled and pulled about as
I was that day.</p>

<p>“We were taken all over the palace, and it vied
throughout in elegance with the great hall. At half
past 12, we were led by the Sultana down to the
reception room to dinner. As we entered, girls bearing
silver basins approached; others with pitchers
poured water over our hands; others again presented
us towels. On the centre of the Persian carpet was
placed a small table, about a foot square, covered
with a cloth of gold tissue. On that was a circular
glass waiter, about three feet in diameter. In the
centre was a dish of roast mutton. The Sultana sat
down, with my mother and self on either side of her;
then E&mdash;&mdash;, and G&mdash;&mdash;, and a lady of the court,
formerly a slave of the Pasha’s, now married to a
colonel. The interpretess stood and carved for us.
The china was French and handsome&mdash;silver knives
and forks, &amp;c., which the Sultana knew not how to
use. She punched at the meat in the most unmerciful
manner. When we sat down, a napkin was
placed on each of our laps; another, embroidered in
gold, laid over the right shoulder; and a third, and
a finer one, laid upon the lap, to wipe the mouth
with. Some of the slaves fanned us&mdash;some held the
different dishes&mdash;others salvers of knives, and others
again silver pitchers, and so on. What with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
beautiful dresses, the glitter of gold and diamonds,
the divan, the spacious hall and fountain, it seemed
that the scenes of the Arabian Nights were realized
before me. I wish you could have seen it. Our
only regret was that this beautiful scene could not
be enjoyed by some of our friends.</p>

<p>“It is said there is no pleasure without pain. Truly
it was so in this case. The dinner was almost
too much for us. We counted thirty-nine different
dishes, served one at a time, and of each we were
obliged to eat a little. And so strangely served as
they were! The first five dishes were of mutton,
rice, &amp;c.,&mdash;then a sweet dish&mdash;then fried fish and
fried lemons&mdash;then meat&mdash;then another sweet dish&mdash;next
fried fish and nuts&mdash;and so on till the thirty-ninth,
which was stewed rice and bonny-clabber.
The glass salver was then taken away, and a silver
one, with melons, peaches, grapes, &amp;c., replaced it.
When we rose from the table, the girls with the
basins knelt before us, and hands were washed as
before, when pipes and coffee were given us to finish
off with. While we smoked, the Sultana retired to
prayers, which she does five times a day. Then if
you could have witnessed the scene, you would have
imagined us amongst a parcel of great children. Oh!
how we were dragged about, patted and pulled; each
woman declaring we belonged to her, and should not
speak to the others. At 3 o’clock we were sent for to depart,
as the gentlemen were satiated with smoking,
and could wait no longer. They had been with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Governor all this time. The Sultana held us tight,
and said the Capidan Pasha had no business to send
for us; and it was 4 o’clock before we could get
away. We made a great procession through the
garden. First went the musical, dancing, and singing
girls; then the Sultana and ourselves, slaves
bearing fans of peacock’s feathers over our heads;
and then came the attendants. At the garden gate,
sherbet was handed, when we took a kind farewell
of our hospitable Sultana, and were consigned to the
care of the male attendants, and at the carriage found
the gentlemen impatient to hear all about what we
had seen.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Visit to the Pyramids. Their diminutive appearance as we approached.
Effect when we reached the base. Pyramid of Cheops.
Visit to the interior. Pyramid of Cephrenes. Belzoni’s forced
passage. His successful researches. Large stone enclosure east
of this Pyramid. Tombs adjoining on the west. Dine in one of
them.</p>

<p>Earliest dawn on the 25th found us up, and our
court filled with animals of all shapes and sizes, from
the towering dromedary to the wee bit of a donkey;
and each one was allowed to choose his mode of
travelling for himself. In the end, I believe, the
largest of us were found on the donkeys, and the
smallest perched on the backs of dromedaries; and
as I was among the former, I amused myself along
the streets with watching my more ambitious companions,
in danger of being caught up, as was
Absalom, if not by their hair at least by the clothes,
and left dangling at the end of the beams that every
where project from the sides of a Turkish bazaar.
The gait of the dromedary is also extremely uncomfortable;
the rider, unless accustomed to it, being
tossed from side to side at each of the long steps
of the animal. I believe when we reached the
Pyramids every one of our ambitious comrades
selected some more humble animal for the rest of the
journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>And here I may be allowed to give a tribute of
just praise to the Egyptian donkeys. They are
extremely small, but beautifully formed, and are of
a mouse color, with a streak of black running along
the back, and intersected by another crossing it at
right angles, and passing down the fore shoulders.
These black lines are believed, by the superstitious
of the Eastern countries, to be copied from the cross,
and to be here in consequence of our Saviour’s having
selected this animal for his entry into Jerusalem.
The Egyptian donkey is very gentle and tractable;
and for riding, is the most agreeable of the donkey
tribe that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Thanks to the tact of Mr. Gliddon, and of our
caterer, Lieut. S., the preparations for our excursion
were admirably made, and we got off without
confusion; although, as we had provisions for two
days, tents, &amp;c., our train consisted of seventy animals;
and our company, amounting to about as many
persons, comprised a singular variety of nations and
languages. Preceded by torches, we marshalled
ourselves in the dark and narrow streets, and the
word being given, at length we put ourselves in
motion.</p>

<p>“Get out of my way, there,” cries an aspirant
after high places to one of more humble elevation;
and the way being cleared, on sweeps the dromedary
at a rapid pace, the saucy occupant of his back now
beginning to bob up and down, and trying in vain to
find something by which he may steady himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and in his efforts to check his beast, only making it
go the faster. “Which is the way?” cry at once
half a dozen travellers, lost in the mazes of the
streets, and each, advising a different course, only
heightening the embarrassment; till at last they
yield the reins to their more sensible mules, which
in a brief space succeed in extricating them.
“Johnny Turk, here, lengthen this stirrup for me,”
says another; when the Arab groom, understanding
only the gesture, and his eyes already offended by
its unwonted and ungraceful length, draws it up
still higher, till he brings the rider in the graceful
attitude of the Turkish horseman, with the knees
up almost to the chin. “What an unsightly attitude,”
the Arab murmurs to himself, “with the
legs sprawling about, when he can bring them close
up to the breast.” To our great satisfaction we
emerged at length from the narrow streets, and had
the pleasure of riding on without incessant danger
of scaling our ancles and knees.</p>

<p>Arriving at Old Cairo, we were ferried across the
river, passing in our course the head of the island
already noticed, and by the edifice with the famous
Nilometer. Opposite to Old Cairo, as I have elsewhere
remarked, is the village of Ghizeh, from which
the largest Pyramids, which we were now about to
visit, take their distinctive name; Ghizeh is celebrated
also for its ovens for hatching chickens.</p>

<p>Passing this, we had now the Pyramids in full
view before us, nine miles distant, but separated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
from us only by the level plain. The morning air
was cool and pleasant, our animals travelled well,
and we left the ground rapidly behind us. But as
we journeyed on, disappointment took possession of
every one of us. The fabrics of which we had
been reading with wonder and admiration from our
childhood, were before us; there were the Pyramids;
but how diminutive!</p>

<p>Still, as we approached them, we watched to see
whether they would not at last appear in that magnitude
and grandeur which we had always connected
with them; but it was all in vain. Each one
indulged in some epithet of dissatisfaction, and even
of contempt; and thus we reached the bottom of the
eminence on which they stand. But when we had
wound up its sides, and reached the piece of table
land on which they are erected; when we checked
our animals at the foot of the first of them, the
Pyramid of Cheops, and looked up; there, they were
again the Pyramids, and grander far than our
fancy had ever pictured them. The effect, indeed,
is almost overpowering. Their simplicity contributes
to this as well as their vastness. There is
nothing to break up and confuse the attention. The
mind, without effort, embraces the whole object; one
single idea occupies the attention; a single impression
is made, but it is astounding; and we feel all
the sublimity of the object, because by this single
impression so great an effect is produced. We cast
our eyes upward; we look again at ourselves, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
we wonder that we are so diminutive; we who just
now were passing sentence of condemnation, and
looking with contempt on this mighty work! We
sink into nothingness beside it, and wish to dismount
and get yet lower, and from an humbler place yield
it the deep homage that the mind willingly pays to
greatness. “This is great, this is very grand,” was
the language from the lips of many, and I believe
from the hearts of all, as we passed along the base
of these stupendous monuments.</p>

<p>There are three of them at this place, called, after
their reputed founders, the Pyramids of Cheops,
Cephrenes, and Mycerinus. They stand on a natural
platform, or piece of table land, one hundred and
fifty feet in height, projected from the adjoining range
of mountains. That of Cheops is the largest, and
has been repeatedly measured; but on account of the
rubbish that has accumulated along the sides, it is
difficult to do this correctly; and there is great discrepancy
in the results.</p>

<p>As the angles are exposed to view quite down to
the foundation, there is less difficulty in ascertaining
the number of layers, which is said to be two hundred
and six; each layer being of smaller dimensions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
than the next lower. A series of steps is thus
formed, each about thirty inches in height and
twenty in width. The Pyramid of Cheops is truncated,
terminating above in a platform of about
twenty feet square; that of Cephrenes is continued
up to a sharp point, and is coated from this about
one fifth of the way down, with triangular blocks,
so as to present, at this part, a perfectly smooth surface.
It is supposed that the whole of this Pyramid
was originally coated in this manner; and that it was
covered with hieroglyphics. I ascended to the
smooth portion of its surface, but could discover no
traces of such inscriptions. The three Pyramids
stand nearly in a straight line, running north and
south, and face exactly the four cardinal points.
Belzoni measured that of Cephrenes, and found it to
be six hundred and eighty-four feet on each side at
the base, and four hundred and fifty-six in height;
that of Mycerinus is much smaller, and has been
mutilated so as to be rather an unsightly object.
They are composed chiefly of secondary limestone
taken from the adjoining mountains. As the angles
of the Pyramids have suffered from the weather, and
probably also from human violence, and have thus
been broken into smaller steps, we were able, without
much difficulty, to ascend to the summit of that
of Cheops. The natives, many of whom had been
attracted from a neighboring village by the sight of
strangers, when seen from this elevation appeared
dwindled into the merest pigmies. A visit into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
interior was a matter of greater difficulty. I had
been over to examine the Pyramid of Cephrenes, and
on returning to that of Cheops, found that the party
had entered, carrying with them all the candles; so
that I had to choose between remaining without or
groping my way along in the dark. Taking a couple
of Arabs, who professed to know the way, I clambered
over a quantity of rubbish, rolled down from
the upper portions of the Pyramid, and reaching to
the entrance. This is on the northern side, about
thirty feet above the base, and at an equal distance
from each of the angles. We here entered a square
passage, three and a half feet on each side; and inclining
at an angle of 26°, which, it is worthy of
remark, is the inclination of the entrance passage in
each of the Pyramids yet explored. This passage
was lined quite around with polished granite; and
the descent would have been dangerous, but for rude
steps or holes for the feet, cut in the lower flags in
more modern times. This passage is about one
hundred feet in length; and by the time we reached
its extremity, daylight had quite deserted us. I
found myself now in a place where I could stand
upright; and after stumbling over some rocks, was
brought to a stand by a rough wall, where the hand
of violence had been at work, probably endeavoring
to force a passage into some of the chambers. Here
an Arab got before to drag, and another behind to
push me, and by their good help I soon found myself
swinging in mid air, in the blackness of darkness;
but presently reached a ledge about eighteen inches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wide, regularly formed, and ascending at the angle
already noticed. Following this up, I at length
began to hear voices, and soon after, to my great
satisfaction, found myself in a lighted chamber, and
once more among my companions. This was what
is called the King’s chamber; a name given to it on
account of a sarcophagus of red granite, seven feet
six inches in length, and of proportionate width and
depth, highly polished, but entirely plain. This
apartment is thirty-seven feet long, seventeen wide,
and about twenty in height; and is cased in every
part with polished Egyptian granite.</p>

<p>Leaving this chamber, and returning part of the
way, I found that the ledge on which I had ascended,
had at its side a passage to another apartment lower
down than the King’s chamber; this is seventeen
feet long, fourteen wide, and twelve feet in height;
and is also cased with polished granite. There
are other chambers in this Pyramid, but of irregular
shape; and it is uncertain whether they were
part of the original design, or are accidental; a pit,
descending, with several offsets, to a depth of one
hundred and fifty-five feet, or to a level with the
Nile, with which it probably had a communication,
has also been explored. It is probable that there are
several other passages not yet discovered, and among
them one by which there was a subterranean
entrance to the Pyramid, a passage, apparently of
this character, having been recently discovered in
the Pyramid of Cephrenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>For what we know of the interior of this latter
Pyramid, which stands within one hundred yards of
that of Cheops, we are indebted to the most enterprising
of all modern travellers, the patient and yet acute
Belzoni. Herodotus had declared that there were
no chambers in this Pyramid; and, except a few lazy
efforts of the Sçavans of the French invading army,
no attempt had been made to ascertain whether this
writer was correct or not. The ambition of Belzoni
having been fired by his success amid the monuments
of Thebes, he determined to make an effort
upon this Pyramid; and he began first by attempting
to force a passage into the northern side. This still
remains as when he abandoned it; and on examining
it, I was struck with astonishment at the perseverance
and determined resolution of the operator.
He has cut a large passage (in many places nine or
ten feet square), for a distance of one hundred feet,
into the heart of the Pyramid; the whole being
through a solid mass of stones, often of prodigious
size. The danger, as well as the expense of this
mode of operating, compelled him at length to abandon
it; but his resolution was not to be overcome.
He examined again the Pyramid of Cheops, and,
after careful admeasurements, discovering that in
this of Cephrenes, at a point corresponding exactly
with the entrance into the former, the surface of the
Pyramid was sunk a little, he commenced here
anew, the native workmen looking on in wonder,
and calling him <em>magnoon</em>, or fool. Having removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a quantity of rubbish and cut through the outer rocks,
he at length found his toils rewarded; slabs of granite,
like those lining the entrance into the other
Pyramid, began to appear; and to his joy he found
at length a similar passage open here before him. It
is four feet in height, and three feet six inches in
width. Having removed the rubbish which had
fallen into it, he reached, at the bottom, a portcullis
of stone, “which,” he says, “stared me in the face,
and said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne plus ultra</i>; putting an end to all my
projects.” With great labor this was raised at
length sufficiently to allow him to creep under; and
“after thirty days,” he adds, “I had the pleasure of
finding myself in the way to the central chamber of
one of the two great Pyramids of Egypt, which have
long been the admiration of beholders.” A passage
cut out of the solid rock, brought him from this to
the entrance of a large chamber.</p>

<p>“I walked,” he says, “slowly two or three paces, and
then stood still to contemplate the place where I was.
Whatever it might be, I certainly considered myself in
the centre of that Pyramid, which, from time immemorial,
had been the subject of obscure conjectures of
many hundred travellers, both ancient and modern.
My torch, formed of a few wax candles, gave but a
glimmering light; I could, however, clearly distinguish
the principal objects. I naturally turned my
eyes to the west end of the chamber, looking for the
sarcophagus, which I strongly expected to see in the
same situation as that in the first Pyramid; but I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was disappointed when I saw nothing there. The
chamber has a pointed or sloping ceiling, and many
of the stones had been removed from their places,
evidently by some one in search of treasure. On
my advancing towards the west end, I was agreeably
surprised to find that there was a sarcophagus
buried on a level with the floor.” A closer examination
led him to the discovery of bones in this
sarcophagus, which, on being sent to London, were
pronounced to be those of a bull, or of that species
of animal; a fact which strengthens the opinion
that the Pyramids were erected by the Egyptians,
not for the burial of their kings, but for religious
purposes. The enterprising traveller, however, found
that he was not the first that had penetrated these
mysterious recesses. The covering of the sarcophagus
had been partly removed; and on going
further, he discovered both Roman and Arabic inscriptions;
the latter stating that “the Master Mohammed
Achmed had opened them.” This chamber is hewn
out of the solid rock, and is forty-six by sixteen feet
at the sides, and twenty-three feet six inches in
height. He discovered some other chambers, and
numerous passages, together with a well, as in the
other Pyramid.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Pyramid of Cephrenes on the
south, are the ruins of a large enclosure, formed of
huge stones; while on the north and west are scattered
a great number of tombs, of heavy and solemn
architecture, forming entire streets. In these the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
stones are also large; they had flat roofs, above
which rose a parapet with heavy mouldings; some
are in good preservation, but most have suffered
greatly from the hand of time, or, more probably, of
human violence; the roofs having fallen in, and the
sands of the desert having entered and filled them
up. Their inner walls are covered with stucco, on
which are painted numerous figures of men and
beasts, in procession or engaged in religious sacrifices,
or in agriculture. We opened a passage into
one of them, and were glad to find in it a refuge from
the fierce sun, which now seemed to be shedding
fire upon us and upon the glowing sands all around.
The tomb consisted of three chambers&mdash;two in good
preservation, and one uncovered; all of them ornamented
in the manner just described; it was large
enough for all our party, except the Arabs, who
seemed to care little for the sun. Our hampers
being dragged in, we enjoyed here a comfortable
meal; after which, retiring to the outer chamber and
making a pillow of the sand, I gazed on the dim
figures traced on the wall, and indulged in antiquarian
reveries.</p>

and Cholula. Their history. Notices of a deluge, and confusion

<p>We are stretched on the sand in a tomb at Ghizeh,
gazing on the solemn and dreamy figures every
where painted on its walls. They carry our thoughts
back to the ancient days, and a spirit of musing
steals gently over us. What is the origin of the Pyramids?
Nay, start not, kind reader, for I am not
going to enter into a disquisition on this worn-out
subject, or to rake up old theories, but to mention a
few circumstances connecting it with our own country,
which have always appeared to me to be extremely
interesting, and which do not seem to have
received the attention that they deserve. It would be
somewhat strange if the obscurity which has hung
over these monuments from the earliest times should
be cleared away by discoveries in this new country
of ours.</p>

<p>About twenty-four miles east of the city of Mexico,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in a plain, called by the aborigines, <em>Micocatl</em>, or <em>the
Path of the Dead</em>, are two Pyramids, one 180, the
other 144 feet in height, the former being 676 feet
on each side, at the base. They are constructed of
clay mixed with small stones, which was encrusted
on the outside with a thick coating of porous amygdaloid.
They presented four stories or platforms,
each considerably narrower than the one next below;
and on the top were originally two colossal statues
of stone, covered with plates of gold, designed to represent
the sun and moon. They are surrounded
by several borders of smaller pyramids, about thirty
feet in height, forming streets, which run exactly in
the direction of the four cardinal points.</p>

<p>Eastward from these, as we descend the Cordilleras,
towards the gulf of Mexico, is the Pyramid of
Papantla. It had seven stories, and was higher in
proportion to its width than any other in the country,
being 59 feet in elevation, and 82 feet on each
side at the base. It was built entirely of hewn stones,
of extraordinary size, regularly shaped and neatly
fitted together. It had three staircases, each leading
to the summit; and the stairs were ornamented with
hieroglyphics, and small niches symmetrically arranged.</p>

<p>South-eastward from the ancient city of Quanhuahuac,
on the western declivity of the Cordillera
of Anahuac, rises an isolated mass of rock, 358 feet
in height, shaped by human labor into a regular
conic form. It has five stories or terraces, the sides
of which incline inward as they ascend, each being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
covered above with masonry; the uppermost of these is
236 feet from north to south, and 315 from east to west;
and is encircled by a wall of hewn stone six feet and
a half in height. The base of the hill is also surrounded
by a deep and very wide ditch, whose outer
circumference measures nearly two miles and a half.
In the centre of the upper natural platform was a
Pyramid of five stories, of which only one now remains.
It faces exactly the four cardinal points, and
is on one side 67, and on the other 57 feet in extent.
The stones of which it is composed are regular in
shape, fitted neatly together, and are covered with
hieroglyphics, each figure occupying several stones;
among them we discovered heads of crocodiles spouting
water, and men sitting cross legged, as is the
custom in Eastern nations.</p>

<p>But the greatest, and perhaps the most ancient of
the Pyramids of this country, is one on the plain of
Cholula, which is separated from the valley of Mexico
by a chain of volcanic mountains, extending from
Popocatepetl towards Rio Frio and the peak of Telapor.
This Pyramid was also so constructed as to
face exactly the four cardinal points, and had a base
of 1449 feet on each side; it rose by four terraces,
and had an elevation of 164 feet. It was built of
unbaked bricks, three inches thick by fifteen in
length, alternating with layers of clay. In some
places it has been penetrated, and chambers have been
laid open, in one of which were found two skeletons,
idols of basalt, and a great variety of vases, polished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and varnished. On the summit of this Pyramid was
an altar dedicated to Quatzee, the god of the air.</p>

<p>These Pyramids of Mexico were in existence when
this region was conquered by the Aztecks, in the year
1190 of our era; and were attributed by the conquerors
to their predecessors, the Toltecks, a powerful
and highly civilized nation, who had obtained possession
of the country about the year A.D. 648. But
whether they were not built by another people long
anterior to the Toltecks, it is now impossible to say,
though it appears probable that they were.</p>

<p>Of the origin of the last of these Pyramids there
is preserved, in the Mexican picture writing,<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a clear
and distinct account, which appears to throw light,
not only on the Pyramids of Mexico, but on those of
Egypt, and on the Pyramidal form so common
among the temples of Hindostan.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“Before the great inundation, which took place 4800
years after the creation of the world, the country of
Anahuac<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> was inhabited by giants. All those who
did not perish, were transformed into fishes, save
seven,<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who fled into caverns. When the waters
had subsided, one of these giants, Xalhua, surnamed
the builder, went to Chohollan, where, as a memorial
of the mountain Haloc, which had served for an
asylum for himself and his six brethren, he built an
artificial hill in form of a Pyramid. He ordered
bricks to be made in the provinces of Tlamanalco, at
the foot of the mountain range of Cocotl; and to convey
them to Cholula, he placed a file of men, who
passed them from hand to hand. The gods beheld
with wrath this edifice, the top of which was to reach
the clouds. Irritated at the daring attempt of Xalhua,
they hurled fire on the Pyramid. Numbers of
the workmen perished; the work was discontinued,
and the monument was afterwards dedicated to
Quetzalcoatl, the god of the air.”<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>To this Humboldt adds,
“Of the different nations that inhabited Mexico,
(at the time of the conquest,) paintings representing
the deluge of Coxcox are found among the Aztecks,
the Miztecks, the Zapotecks, the Tlascalans, and the
Mechoacanese. The Noah, Xisuthrus or Menou of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
these nations is called Coxcox, Teo-Cipactli, or Tezpi.
He saved himself conjointly with his wife Xochiquetzal
in a bark; or, according to other traditions,
on a raft of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ahue huete</i> (cupressus disticha.) The
painting represents Coxcox in the midst of the water,
lying in a bark. The mountain, the summit of
which, crowned by a tree, rises above the waters, is
the peak of Colhuacan,<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the Ararat of the Mexicans.
The horn which is represented on the left, is the
phonetic hieroglyphic of Colhuacan. At the foot of
the mountain appear the heads of Coxcox and his
wife. The latter of these is known by the two
tresses in the form of horns, which, as we have observed,
denote the female sex. The men born after
the deluge were dumb; a dove from the top of a tree
distributes among them tongues, represented under
the form of small commas. We must not confound
this dove with the bird which brings Coxcox tidings
that the waters were dried up. The people of Machoacan
preserved a tradition, according to which,
Coxcox, whom they call Tezpi, embarked in a spacious
<i lang="nah" xml:lang="nah">acalli</i> with his wife, his children, several animals,
and grain, the preservation of which was of importance
to mankind. When the Great Spirit, Tetcatlipoca,
ordered the waters to withdraw, Tezpi sent out
from his bark a vulture, the Zohilote (vultur aura).
This bird, which feeds on dead flesh, did not return on
account of the great number of carcasses with which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the earth, recently dried up, was strewed. Tezpi
sent out other birds, one of which, the hummingbird,
alone returned, holding in his beak a branch
covered with leaves. Tezpi, seeing that fresh verdure
began to clothe the soil, quitted his bark near
the fountain of Colhuacan.... The tongues
which the dove distributed to the nations of America,
being infinitely varied, these nations disperse; and
fifteen heads of families only, who spoke the same
tongue, and from whom the Toltecks, the Aztecks,
and the Acolhuans descended, unite, and arrive at
Aztlan.” Ib. II. p. 63.</p>

<p>“The group, No. 2,<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> represents the celebrated <em>Serpent
Woman</em>, Cihuacohuatl, called also Quiliztli or
Tonacacihua, <em>woman of our flesh</em>; she is the companion
of Tonacateuctli. The Mexicans considered
her as the mother of the human race; and after the
god of the <em>Celestial Paradise</em>, Ometeuctli, she held
the first rank among the divinities of Anahuac. We
see her always represented with a great serpent.
Other paintings exhibit to us a feather-headed snake,
cut in pieces by the great spirit Tercatlipoca, or by
the sun personified, the god Tonatiuh....</p>

<p>“Behind the serpent, who appears to be speaking
to the goddess Cihuacohuatl, are two naked figures;
they are of a different color, and seem to be in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
attitude of contending with each other. We might
be led to suppose that the two vases, which we see
at the bottom of the picture, one of which is overturned,
is the cause of this contention. The Serpent
woman was considered in Mexico as the mother
of two twin children; these naked figures are perhaps
the children of Cihuacohuatl; they remind us
of the Cain and Abel of the Hebrew tradition.” Ib.
I. p. 195.</p>

<p>Pyramidal structures are also found scattered over
the islands of the Pacific. “The natural temples (in
the Polynesian islands) consisted of a number of distinct
Maraes, altars, and sacred dormitories, appropriated
to the chief pagan divinities, and included in
one large stone enclosure of considerable extent.
Several of the distinct temples contained smaller inner-courts,
within which the gods were kept. The
form of the interior or area of the temples was frequently
that of a square or a parallelogram, the sides
of which extended forty or fifty feet. Two sides of
this were enclosed by a high stone wall; the front
was protected by a low fence; and opposite, <em>a solid
Pyramidal structure</em> was raised, in front of which
the images were kept, and the altars fixed. These
piles were often immense. That which formed one
side of the square of the large temple in Atehura, according
to Mr. Wilson, by whom it was visited when
in a state of preservation, was 270 feet long, 94 feet
wide at the base, and 50 feet high; being at the
summit 180 feet long and 6 wide. A flight of steps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
led to its summit; the bottom step was six feet
high. The outer stories of the Pyramid, composed
of coral and basalt, were laid with great care, and
hewn or squared with immense labor, especially the
<em>trava</em>, or corner stones.” Ellis’s Polynesian Researches,

<p>“The most remarkable objects in Easter Island, are
its monuments of stone-work and sculpture, which,
though rude and imperfect, are superior to any found
among the more numerous and civilized tribes of the
South Sea islands. These monuments consist of a
number of terraces or platforms, built with stairs,
cut and fixed with great exactness and skill, forming,
though destitute of cement, a strong durable pile.
On these terraces are fixed colossal statues or busts.”<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Ib. vol. III. p. 325.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>Last among the Pyramids that I will notice here,
though the first in date, is the celebrated tower of
Babel, or, as it was afterwards called, the temple of
Belus. This temple was square, measuring at its
base 660 feet on each side; and consisted of eight
successive layers or towers, formed of huge unburnt
bricks, each layer 75 feet high, and each smaller than
the next below. It was thus altogether 600 in height,
and had on the summit a chapel for the golden statue
of their god. According to Diodorus Siculus,
the gold of this statue, and the decorations of the
temple, were equal in value to <a id="Ref_105" href="#RRef_105">ten</a> millions of dollars;
while the worth of the utensils employed, and the
treasure deposited here, amounted to an equal sum.</p>

<p>We have thus, throughout Hindoostan, on the
banks of the Euphrates, through Egypt, in the
remote region of Mexico, and among the Pacific
islands, structures in shape exactly alike, and often
of stupendous magnitude. For an effect so general
we must find a cause as extensive, and it must be
one operating with powerful effect. It appears to
me that we are supplied with this in the hints given
by the picture writing of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>After the confusion of languages at the tower of
Babel, the stricken and confounded families of the
plain of Shinar, as they were gradually scattered
over different, and often far distant regions, carried
with them, each, not only a deep impression of the
event, but also a feeling of awe connected with the
edifice where had been such a wonderful display of
supernatural power. And they afterwards adopted
this structure, as the model for temples for the worship
of the mysterious divinities that their superstitious
fears gradually wrought out for them, the god
of fire, the god of the sun, or the god of the palpable
but invisible air.</p>

<p>We have here a <a id="Ref_106" href="#RRef_106">case</a> sufficiently extensive in
its operation, and also sufficiently powerful. When
looking at the huge structures in Egypt, I can
hardly imagine any other cause than that of religion
to be able to produce such a stupendous effect.</p>

<p>Only one of the Pyramids of Ghizeh is truncated,
or adapted for a chapel on its summit; that of
Cephrenes might have had its altar in the huge
stone enclosure already noticed as directly adjoining
it on the east; but it is probable that in this land of
mystery, the solemnities, whatever they were, were
performed chiefly in the hidden chambers of the
Pyramids, to which the priests had access by subterranean
passages.</p>

<p>The idea that they were places for worship, is
perhaps strengthened by the presence of the colossal
Sphinx, which lies about two hundred yards east<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
from them, and on the side of the eminence on which
they stand. Avenues of sphinxes leading to their
temples were common in the ancient Egyptian cities;
and in Memphis, if my memory is correct, was one
of great extent, formed by colossal sphinxes, which
have all disappeared. May we not suppose that this,
which now stands alone, was, or was intended to be,<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
one of a great number, forming a most imposing
avenue, leading upward from the plain to these stupendous
temples? Its face is towards the east, and
it adjoins what was evidently the ancient way of
ascent to the Pyramids.</p>

<p>The dimensions of this Sphinx, as given by
Pococke, are, height of the head and neck, twenty-seven
feet; breast, thirty-three feet wide; whole
length of the figure, one hundred and thirty feet.
Pliny states its height to be equal to sixty-three
English feet. It is now covered with sand, except
the head and shoulders. Some years since the whole
figure was laid bare by the persevering efforts of
Mr. Caviglia; but the light sands of the desert
speedily resumed their place, and have left no traces
of his labors.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would throw out the query, (and
it is only a query,) whether the mounds in our
western country, which are often of prodigious size,
had not the same origin and a similar purpose, the
circular form being only a slight change in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the material here employed. The Pyramid
of Quanhuahuac, in Mexico, was built on a hill
wrought into shape of a cone; and at Ruapua, in
Hawaii, (or Owhyhee,) Mr. Ellis visited a <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">heiau</i>, or
open temple, in which “the place where the altar
had been erected could be distinctly traced; it was a
<em>mound of earth</em>, paved with smooth stones, and surrounded
by a firm curb of lava.” Polyne. Researches,
v. iv., 116.</p>

<p>But up! up! and let us get out once more into
the pure and open air. The fiery sun is throwing
his rays slantingly, and the Pyramids are casting
long shadows across the plain; and, though over
yon sandy mountains and the panting deserts beyond,
the sky is still in a glow, the fury of the heat is past.
Turn here to the eastward. In this clear and pure
atmosphere, how distinct are distant objects. From
our elevated ground we trace the courses of the
numerous canals, intersecting the wide plain beneath;
yonder is Cairo, a white house here and there giving
a mottled appearance to the reddish mass of edifices;
there goes the silvery river, in gentle and graceful
curves; and here, on our left, stretches off towards
it a low ridge or causeway, supposed by some to
have been made for transporting stone for the Pyramids
from the river, but which was more probably
formed when this region was robbed to supply Cairo
with building materials.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>How calm now and quiet is all this scene; but over
this plain only a few years ago swept the wild and destructive
hurricane of war. There, a few miles from
where we stand, advanced the legions of France, led by
him who was himself a host; and there wheeled the
squadrons of the fierce Mamelukes; and here both
rushed on to the bloody encounter. What spot on
earth is there that man has not marked with deeds
of violence, or from which the voice of his brother’s
blood, shed by him, hath not cried to heaven from
the ground?</p>

<p>Looking southward from our present position, the
Pyramids of Sakhara were striking objects in the
plain of Memphis, distant seven or eight miles.
They are on the level plain, and are, I think, six in
number, but are small compared with those of
Ghizeh. One of them was remarkable, even at this
distance, for the ruggedness of its outline; the successive
layers of stones in this receding very much,
and making it resemble considerably the Pyramids
of Mexico.</p>

<p>Towards evening the party, once more resuming
their various means of conveyance, proceeded on by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the Pyramids of Sakhara; and on the plains of
Memphis found, through the foresight of Mr. Gliddon,
a comfortable supper and commodious tents
prepared for them. This plain is covered with
ruins, often of great size, but too unsatisfactory at
the present time to detain a traveller long; and the
company embarked at an early hour on the following
day on board Mr. Gliddon’s boat.</p>

<p>On the right bank of the Nile, about seven miles
from Cairo, is the military and naval school of
Toura, an admirably conducted institution, under
the superintendence of a Spanish gentleman, General
Seguira. He was a high officer in the constitutional
government of Spain, and having been exiled in
consequence, has been protected by Mohammed Ali,
who had sense enough to see and appreciate his
merit. He has his family with him at Cairo, holds
the rank of Bey, and receives the liberal salary of
$11,000 per annum. The college edifice consists
of a quadrangle, inclosing a court planted with
shade trees for the recreation of the pupils. Each
lad has for himself an iron bedstead, mattress, &amp;c.,
a bureau, secretary, and a chair. The sleeping
rooms are large enough to accommodate thirty-seven
of them in each, together with a teacher; in the
school-room they have also every comfort, and a
hospital is also provided for the sick.</p>

<p>The party landing here, were received with great
politeness by Gen. Seguira, who, after conducting
them through the buildings, and calling on the lads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to exhibit their proficiency in geometry, trigonometry,
and drawing, ordered those destined to be
artillerists to bring their cannon on the ground for
practice. The young cadets (about twelve or fourteen
years of age) wheeled their guns to the spot,
and went through a variety of evolutions with great
rapidity, firing at the targets with admirable success.
Their improvement in the school for drawing is also
wonderful, if we consider the short time which they
have been able to allot to this branch. The young
naval heroes did not appear to be so well trained;
there are two armed brigs anchored in the river
opposite the school, on board of which they <a id="Ref_111" href="#RRef_111">are</a>
examined in loosing and furling sails, lowering yards,
splicing and knotting, unmooring and mooring, and
in practising the guns; but the evolutions which
they attempted on this occasion, were pronounced
by our tars to be sufficiently awkward. We had,
however, frequent opportunity of seeing the Pasha’s
ships manoeuvring at sea, and saw no occasion for
finding fault. The school at Toura contains about
four hundred lads, and considering the short time
which it has been in operation, reflects great credit,
both on the Pasha, and its polite superintendent
Gen. Seguira.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Rest on the Sabbath. Visit to the Pasha’s summer residence at
Shubra. Exceeding beauty of the ground. Lake, and sports of
the Pasha. Pic-nic in one of the Kiosks. Pear tree from the
Pasha’s place of nativity. Brief history of Mohammed Ali.
Departure from Cairo. Regret at parting with Mr. Gliddon.</p>

<p>Sunday, 27th, was a day of rest, which our previous
severe exercise made unusually refreshing.
In the afternoon Gen. Seguira and family, Mr. Taylor,
an English gentleman, and his lady, and the French
consul, called to pay their respects to the Commodore
and family.</p>

<p>The next morning our baggage was again transferred
to the boats, which were sent down the river
with orders to wait for us at the palace of Shubra;
and towards noon, mounting our gallant steeds for
the last time, we wheeled out into the avenue leading
to that magnificent summer residence of the Pasha.
Our company was augmented by Mrs. Seguira, her
two daughters and son, who had accepted an invitation
to a pic-nic, by which the day, and with it, our
visit to Cairo, was to be concluded. The members
of this family all speak English fluently, and we
found them a delightful acquisition to our party.</p>

<p>The gardens at Shubra are under the care of a
native horticulturist, who had been sent by the Pasha
to France, and had spent six years on an experimental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
farm near Marseilles. He received us politely
at the gate, and ushering us in, we found ourselves
in a scene more like the creation of a wild
and luxurious fancy, revelling in joyous freedom
and without restraint, than a thing of real life. The
first walk into which we turned was lined thickly
on either side with oleanders in full bloom, mingled
with roses and jessamine; they grew to the height
of ten or twelve feet, and bending over the path, suspended
over us a canopy of flowers, from which the
richest odors were distilled. The vista was terminated
by some striking and beautiful object, which
I do not recollect, for the mind was too intoxicated
to make careful observations, and I desired to look
and drink in the rich pleasure rather than to note.
The grounds, we were informed, contain one hundred
and fifty acres; we rambled over a portion of
them, and found every where something to admire.
By and by our course was arrested by a lake embowered
amid lofty and spreading trees; it is of a
quadrangular form, and is surrounded by an arcade
of marble, at each angle of which is a kiosk or summer-house
richly furnished. In the middle of each
of the four sides is a portico, formed of Italian marbles;
and here, as well as in the kiosks, are marble
figures spouting out water, which is carried around
in marble troughs, and made to descend by cascades
into the lake. In the centre is an island with
a marble edifice, to which is an ascent by a flight of
steps of the same material. It is apparently supported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
by four crocodiles in marble, also spouting
water. The <a id="Ref_114" href="#RRef_114">water</a> is about four feet in depth,
and is also paved below with marble. This is a
favorite resort of the Pasha, and we saw a boat in
which it is said he sometimes carries out his wives;
when well off from the shore, he upsets the boat, and
amuses himself with seeing them flounder in the
water. At the time of our visit the place was undergoing
some improvements.</p>

<p>There is also a menagerie in the gardens, but the
most valuable animals had just been given away,
and at this time it did not contain any thing very remarkable.
The palace itself, into which we were
admitted, and where we were shown over the ladies’
apartments, is richly furnished, but not equal to the
one in the citadel.</p>

<p>After rambling about till our curiosity was satisfied,
we retired to a large kiosk, whose soft ottomans
invited to repose; and our hampers of claret and
champagne having been brought in, the corks were
made to fly in the very penetralia of the Moslem
Pasha; nor were his officers loth to pledge their impudent
guests. To our feast the superintendent of
the grounds added an abundance of choice fruit from
the gardens. The Misses Seguiras had brought their
guitars, and music was also made to lend its charms;
they sing sweetly, and accompanied the instruments
in some of the airs of their distant father-land.</p>

<p>This name of father-land reminds us of a tree
which we passed at the early part of our saunterings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
through this garden. We had come to a spot where
a covered walk, bordered by flowers, suddenly expands
into a little open area, paved with pebbles
from Rhodes, which, being of different colors, are arranged
so as to form a tasteful mosaic work. In the
centre is a kind of canopied throne, and the whole
spot bears the marks of unusual attention. The superintendent
directed our attention to a pear tree
growing at one side of the opening; it was slender,
but healthful looking, and bearing fruit. “That
tree,” he said, “was brought by his excellency the
Pasha from his native town, and was planted here
by his own hand, and he seems to take particular
care in nourishing it.”</p>

<p>The fact discloses to us a vein of sentiment in that
extraordinary man which we should scarcely have
expected to exist. He is said, however, to be very
kind in his domestic relations. His eldest children
have all been carried off by disease, or (as in the
case of Youssoun) by violence; those still living,
three in number, are quite young, and he often amuses
himself in playing with them in this garden.</p>

<p>Mohammed Ali is a native of Cavalla, a small
town in Albanie, and owes his present exalted station
entirely to his own intrepidity. He began his
public career as a subordinate collector of taxes in
his native district; and, on one occasion, having distinguished
himself in putting down some refractory
inhabitants who had refused to pay their part of the
contributions, was rewarded by the governor of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
place with a rich wife and the rank of Boulouk
Bashi. Soon after this he became a dealer in tobacco,
without however forgetting his profession of
arms; he was successful in trade, but in a short
time the invasion of Egypt by the French, called his
talents into a higher sphere of operation. He was
raised to the rank of Bimbashi or captain, and sent
to Egypt with 300 men, the quota of soldiers furnished
by Cavalla on this occasion. His bravery in
this country soon drew the attention of his superior
officers, and led to his advancement to higher rank;
and at length, after the massacre of the Mamelukes
by the Turkish admiral at Aboukir, as already noticed,
Mohammed Ali was placed in command of one
division of the forces destined to march against the
remainder in Upper Egypt, and effect their extermination.
The Mamelukes, however, fought with desperation,
and their enemies were defeated; and Yousef
Bey, who had the supreme command in this expedition,
in order to shield himself from trouble,
charged Mohammed Ali with treachery. The latter
was near losing his head; but he managed affairs
with skill, and gained a kingdom. The army had
been badly paid, and was disaffected towards their
rulers; he had ingratiated himself with the soldiers,
and seizing the occasion, he first rid himself of the
Turkish viceroy, and then of the leading Mameluke
Beys, and soon after was entreated by the army to
save Egypt from destruction by becoming himself
the chief representative of the Porte. He yielded of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
course, and the Sultan being compelled to yield also,
appointed him, though sorely against his will, the
Viceroy of Egypt. I have related the manner in
which he soon after exterminated the Mamelukes,
and the reader is himself aware how he has since
made himself, in effect, entirely independent of the
Porte.</p>

<p>Our friends were compelled to leave us in time to
get back to the city before sunset, when the gates are
closed; and bidding them a reluctant farewell, we
ourselves moved down to the river, and took once
more possession of our boats, which were there
awaiting us. Mr. Gliddon, we found, had lent his
own comfortable boat for the use of the Commodore
and his family.</p>

<p>So adieu to Cairo! Our attendants had been rewarded
with “beckshishes,” or presents, in return
for their own services, and for the use of the horses;
the Cavasses and Chaouishes had been paid; the city,
I believe, was at peace with us, and we had received
much pleasure in it; and now, stepping from the
gardens into our boats, we began to drop down the
stream, Mr. Gliddon and Mr. Trail were kind
enough to accompany us as far as the Barage, where
we came to for the night, and where, in the morning,
they went with us to examine this stupendous undertaking.
To both of these gentlemen we owe
many thanks, and to the former in particular, though
far off, we all bear grateful hearts. “Two weeks’
residence in the same house,” (I take the liberty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
copying from the Commodore’s private journal,) “and
constant communication, with his amenity of manners,
and his devotion to our comforts, and to render
our visit pleasant, had greatly attached all to him;
he planned our excursions, and took the trouble to
provide the means to enable us to effect them; and
to him we are indebted for having obtained views of
every thing in and about Cairo worthy of attention.
We shall never forget the very happy time we passed
at Cairo under his hospitable roof. It was therefore
with the deepest regret that we bid him adieu, and
saw him leap to the shore, amid three hearty cheers
from us all. May he prosper in all his undertakings,
and be happy!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Return to Alexandria. Ruins about that city. Pompey’s pillar.
Cleopatra’s needles. Modern improvements in Alexandria. Arsenal.
Harbor of Alexandria. Rail road to Suez. New law for
protecting his subjects. Presentation to the Pasha. Description
of his person.</p>

<p>Our return to Atf occupied four days, one day
more than our voyage up the stream; as the wind
still blew strong from the northward during the day,
our progress was chiefly during the night, when we
took advantage of the lull, and dropped down with
the current.</p>

<p>On our reaching Alexandria, an officer of the
Pasha waited on Commodore Patterson, to offer him
the use of one of his palaces, a large airy building
on the edge of the harbor, and enjoying the sea-breeze
during most of the day. The Pasha himself
had returned from Syria, and on application for an
audience, the morning of the 5th of August was appointed
for this purpose. The interval was spent in
making and returning visits of ceremony, in inspecting
the arsenal, and in examining the ruins about
Alexandria. Of the latter there is the greatest abundance,
extending for miles from the present city;
but in most places presenting only a confused mass,
which can give little satisfaction to the visitor. The
Catacombs are a succession of chambers extending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to an unknown distance, and dangerous to visit, on
account of the facility with which a person may be
lost in their labyrinths. Pompey’s Pillar, a Corinthian
column, 9 feet in diameter, and of 90 feet elevation,
to which is added a capital of ten feet in
height, stands on a low eminence about two miles
back of the present city; a dedicatory inscription to
the Emperor Dioclesian is to be seen on the pedestal,
but it is difficult to say by whom the column was
erected.</p>

<p>In an angle of the present city walls, on the eastern
side, are the two obelisks which usually go under
the name of Cleopatra’s Needles. They were probably
brought from Heliopolis or Thebes, to adorn
an ancient gateway, or the entrance to a temple.
They are eight feet on each side at the base, and are
64 feet in length; are of red granite, and covered with
hieroglyphics. One is prostrate and broken; but
the other is still erect, and is in good preservation.</p>

<p>The modern city of Alexandria is more an European
than a Turkish or Arab city; it is full of
Franks, and a large portion of it is laid out after the
European fashion; this is particularly the case with
an open square, around which they have just finished
some large edifices in the Grecian or Roman style
of architecture. I cannot say that I consider this
imitation of European cities in Eastern countries a
great improvement. About a mile and a half from
the city is a garden belonging to Ibrahim Pasha, but
open to the public; it is irrigated by water raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
from the canal, and is full of thriving fruit or shade
trees, under which is found a delightful retreat from
the scorching sun.</p>

<p>While these improvements of a civil nature were
going on in and about the city, the arsenals exhibited
a very active scene. They were then forming a
dry dock, and so deficient were they in tools, that
the materials excavated were passed up and thrown
out by hand; the number of the workmen, however,
making amends for the want of instruments. They
expected to complete it in two years, when they
would immediately commence two others; the stone
for them has all to be brought from Cairo. There were
five building ways complete, and two in progress;
on the stocks were three ships of 100 guns each,
ready for planking; and the day after our arrival the
keel of a sixty gun frigate was laid with religious
ceremonies; the Pasha himself, and his officers of
state, attending on the occasion. The timber is
brought from Syria, where they procure both oak
and pine in the greatest quantities, and of an excellent
quality. Their ships are even more wall-sided
than our own; but in all other respects they follow
the French style of building; and according to a
fashion now beginning to prevail in the navy of that
country, keep all the decks for cannons clear of staterooms
and other encumbrances; the whole battery
being quite clear, fore and aft, and at all times ready
for action. The officers’ rooms are all placed on the
orlop, which is well supplied with air-ports. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
largest ship carried 138 guns, and was constructed
to meet one belonging to the Sultan, and carrying
144. Owing to a difficulty in getting her out of the
harbor, they were, at the time of our visit, reducing
her to one deck less. The harbor of Alexandria is
spacious and of sufficient depth, but the entrance is
winding and difficult, and the channel is obstructed
with knowls of rock, over which there is but four
fathoms’ water. The Pasha had sent to England
for steam machinery for breaking down these rocks,
and as they are of sand-stone, he will probably succeed.
In the arsenal are rope-walks, two stories in
height, and large ranges of store-houses well supplied.
The whole establishment exhibited a neatness, and
order, and efficiency, that greatly pleased our officers.
The seamen receive, first class $2, and the second
class 1.50 per month, together with clothing and a ration.
The officers are well paid, and on receiving
their commission, receive with it an anchor, together
with one, two, or three stars, made of diamonds, the
number being according to their rank; these, worn
on the breast, constitute their only distinctive uniform.
The admiral, rear-admiral, and all officers of a
lower grade, are natives; the vice-admiral is a
Frenchman, and so also is the chief naval constructor.</p>

<p>However strongly we must condemn the iron despotism
of the Pasha of Egypt as regards his subjects,
in all public improvements there is very much that
we may approve. In addition to the schools at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Toura, and in the citadel, each of four hundred lads
supported at the public expense, there is one also at
Castleaine, in Old Cairo, kept in a large palace, and
containing 1000; another at Boulec containing 600;
and another is to be got up in the same place, to contain
also 1000; all of which are at the expense of
the government. At Boulec is also a surgical and
medical school, under the care of a German of great
ability. In addition to the public improvements
which I have noticed, it is in contemplation to construct
a railway from Cairo to Suez, the route for
which has already been surveyed. The day before
we sailed, the Pasha directed his chief engineer, Mr.
Galloway, to proceed to England, and make contracts
for iron rails, cars, engines, &amp;c.; the estimated
expense of the whole work was 806,400 dollars;
he intends, by and by, to extend this rail road to
Alexandria.</p>

<p>With regard to his subjects, he has made an excellent
law, by which no one is allowed to be punished
capitally without his permission. A short time before
our visit, a man of wealth, and high in rank,
having put one of his slaves to death, was sent for,
and ordered forthwith into the presence of the Pasha.
The fact was admitted, but he pleaded that the man
had been his own slave, and that therefore he had
felt at liberty to do with him as he might choose.
“No,” was the reply from the Pasha; “though he
was your slave, he was still <em>my subject</em>;” and to
make the case an impressive one, he ordered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
master himself immediately to be led to execution.
There is a doubt, however, whether his object, in
this instance, was so much to protect “his subjects,”
as to rid himself of a citizen who had several times
given him some trouble, and whose wealth he
coveted; the property of criminals, capitally punished
in this country, always falling into the hands
of the sovereign.</p>

<p>The city of Alexandria stands on a piece of land
resembling the letter T, with a harbor on each side;
and on the strip or point running westward, stands
the palace of the Pasha. On the morning of the 5th,
the Commodore, Captain Nicolson, and as many of
the officers as could be spared from duty, took boats,
and landed at a flight of stairs leading up to the inner
court.</p>

<p>The building, in which is the audience hall, is
large, but has nothing striking in its exterior; and
the hall itself is in a style of plainness that seems to
show a mind overlooking all artificial helps to greatness.</p>

<p>The Pasha was seated at one angle, and on our
entering, put the Commodore at his left hand, which
in these countries is the seat of honor; he received
us sitting, but stood up when the Commodore rose
to leave the room, which, I believe, is an unusual
compliment. After the compliments usual on such
occasions, coffee and sherbet were brought in by
the attendants, but pipes were omitted. I was informed
that, on the occasion of the recent introduction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of an English traveller, some difficulty had
arisen on this score; if I recollect right, the gentleman
had declined the pipe, which was considered
by the Pasha as an insult. At all events, since that
time pipes have always been dispensed with at his
interviews with foreigners.</p>

<p>The Commodore thanked him for the numerous
instances of hospitality and kindness which we had
experienced, and spoke in terms of admiration of his
various improvements, to all which he made suitable
answers; and expressing himself also in terms of
strong friendship for our country, and hinting a desire
for more intimate relations. He showed considerable
knowledge of our institutions, and put many
pertinent questions with regard to the productions
of the country, our modes of cultivation, &amp;c.; and
expressed great surprise when the Commodore stated
the size to which the coffee tree grows in the West
Indies, it being in Egypt and Arabia only a shrub,
which must be renewed every five or six years.</p>

<p>Mohammed Ali is about 60 or 65 years of age,
about five feet eight inches in height, and heavy; though
he can scarcely be called corpulent. His forehead
is large and rough; the eyes gray and small, with a
deep wrinkle running upward from the outer angle;
they are very keen and restless; and I believe there
was not one of our large party upon whom they
were not repeatedly fixed during this interview.
He converses with earnestness, and laughs frequently,
but his laugh is discordant and unnatural.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The nose is aquiline, the mouth depressed at the
corners, and garnished with a superb silvery beard.
The expression of his face when he smiles is rather
pleasant; but at other times a person in his presence
feels as he would do near an open barrel of gunpowder,
with a shower of red-hot cinders falling
around him.</p>

<p>We left the coast of Egypt on the 10th of August.
Early on the morning of the 12th we had the pleasure
of seeing the hills of Palestine emerging from the
waters. What a thrill was occasioned by the sight!</p>

<p>The birth-place of a wide-spread and wonderful
religion&mdash;the land of a thousand miracles&mdash;the original
home of a people now spread every where,
and every where a miracle; and every where, from
Lapland to India, still yearning towards their father-land&mdash;the
mountains, the plains of Judea were before
us. In our earliest infancy we had tried to picture
them&mdash;they were mingled with the deepest and
warmest feelings of our maturer years; in imagination
how often had we wandered over the hallowed
ground, and here before us was now the reality itself.</p>

<p>A stretch of low and whitish coast gradually developed
itself; and beyond this, at the distance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
several miles, rose a chain of hills, as our glasses informed
us, under pretty good cultivation, and
sprinkled with villages. By and by the sun was
reflected from a mass of white houses on the shore,
encircled with walls and towers; this was Jaffa&mdash;the
Joppa of the Scriptures, and the ancient as well as the
present seaport of Jerusalem. I believe I may say
there was a very strong sensation excited universally
throughout the ship by the scene before us; for the
religion of Judea had at least been that of our childhood,
and there was probably scarcely an individual
among us, in whose mind it was not connected with
the tenderness of a good parent, or the kindness of
some early friend still dear to our memory.</p>

<p>Our noble ship glided on, and began to approach
the coast. She was the first American vessel that had
ever entered these waters; and in her joyous motion,
as she pushed the ripples aside, and threw back
the morning rays from a cloud of canvass, we could
almost imagine a participation in the feelings of her
inmates. The stripes and stars were presently replied
to by a similar ensign over the house of our
consul at Jaffa; and the other consuls following
suite, there was presently a display of nearly all the
European flags in that ancient city.</p>

<p>The city of Jaffa is built on the side of a hill that
rises immediately from the water’s edge; the houses
are white, rising tier above tier; many are covered
with whitewashed domes; and the white being now
relieved by the consular flags, it had quite a pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
appearance; its walls and towers, and a castle at the
upper extremity, gave it also a show of strength; and
had we found time for it, this proud array of pennon
and battlement, assisted as it was by an encampment
of soldiers in the neighborhood, might easily have
carried the mind back to the days of chivalry and
romance.</p>

<p>But we were occupied chiefly with ourselves; for
with our pleasure at seeing the Holy Land was mingled
an apprehension that, after all, we should not be
permitted to set foot on shore. At Alexandria we
had dire accounts of earthquake and war; and, what
alarmed us more, of the plague; for although not
one of us but would have been willing to meet this
disease in his own individual case for the sake of
seeing Jerusalem, yet the risk of introducing it into
the ship was not to be thought of, and we knew that
if there was any danger of this, the commodore
would at once decide to have no communication.
With these anxieties we approached the coast; and
as the ship speeds onward, it may be well to state to
the reader what was the state of Palestine at this
time.</p>

<p>The ever-restless Pasha of Egypt had, about two
years previous, without any warning to his master
the Sultan, marched a large army into the country;
and, on pretence of settling some difficulties
among the natives, had seized on its strong places;
after which he set the Turkish power at defiance.
The Egyptian soldiers are almost universally men of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
light, but active and well-knit frames; and are capable
of enduring fatigue, and fitted for any kind of warfare.
The restlessness of their sovereign keeps them
also in a state of constant activity; and many of them,
though young, are already veterans in the field.
The Turkish soldiers, on the other hand, are unused
to motion&mdash;are mostly without experience, and lack
confidence both in themselves and in their new system,
which they but imperfectly understand. They
have no particular attachment to their officers; while
the Egyptians, though at first disliking military
service, are said in a short time to become so fond
of it, as to have and to desire no other home than
their tent; they feel also, universally, a strong attachment
both to Ibrahim Pasha and to Mahomet Ali.</p>

<p>We may find in all this the secret of their success
whenever brought into contact with the Turkish
soldiery; and there can be little doubt, that if foreign
powers had not interfered, Mahomet Ali, if he had
chosen, might have seated himself on the throne of
Constantinople. Some of the Turkish soldiers taken
in the recent expedition toward the Turkish capital,
were sent to Egypt as prisoners; and we were informed,
excited universal ridicule in their passage through
Syria by their sluggish and awkward movement.
But I have wandered a little from my subject.</p>

<p>On getting possession of Syria, Mahomet Ali began
there the same system that he had been pursuing in
Egypt, but without having properly weighed the
difference in the native character. He first laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
heavy exactions on the purses of the inhabitants,
who indeed had little to spare, the country producing
scarcely more than enough for their own support.
This they bore, though with grumbling: tax after
tax was laid, and with difficulty raised; and a general
dissatisfaction was the consequence. At length
he demanded their sons for his army and navy, and
at once, the whole infuriated populace rose into rebellion.
“Take our purses,” they cried, “if it must be
so; we can part with them; but our children we will
not give.” Jerusalem, where the Egyptian garrison
was strongest, was in a few days invested by a force
of 20,000 men, fierce and lawless people, and now
maddened into phrenzy. This was eleven weeks
previous to our visit. The rebels were badly provided
with ammunition, and had no cannon, but spread
themselves over the hills around, hoping, perhaps, to
starve the garrison into terms, or succeed by stratagem;
or more probably, scarcely knowing themselves
what they wanted, or whither to direct their
efforts. It seems to have been a sudden and universal
outburst of indignant feeling, almost without aim
and without hope. The reader, to form a conception
of the scene, must fancy a people, in color, costume,
and disposition, very much like the Indian
tribes bordering on our white settlements; for such,
in a striking degree, are the appearance and character
of the country population of Palestine.</p>

<p>I have selected for this comparison the Indians
dwelling on our borders, as their debased character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and squalid appearance bring them nearer to the
Arabs of Palestine than are their brethren further
back; and except that the Arab lacks the
broad face and high cheek bone of the Indian, I
could almost have fancied the wild looking beings
whom I have seen stalking into Jerusalem, to be a
portion of the same wretched people we often meet
in the streets of our frontier towns. Their dress
consists of a <em>hyck</em>, a species of long blanket wrapped
around them, in the manner that the blanket is
used by our Indians; and, as with them, under garments
are sometimes employed, and sometimes the
<em>hyck</em> is the only garment; over the head a handkerchief
is thrown so as to leave the face exposed, and
falls over the neck and shoulders, and this is kept in
its place by a small fillet drawn tight over the temples.
From beneath the handkerchief peep out
dark elfin locks and black uneasy eyes, while the expression
of the face is any thing but gentle or attractive.
A large part of them are indeed robbers by
profession, and plunder without scruple whenever
any one more helpless than themselves may happen
to fall in their way.</p>

<p>The condition of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, when
they found themselves encircled by this wild and
lawless host, was, as may be imagined, a very uncomfortable
one; but another horror was immediately
added, one of a more frightful, because more
mysterious character. It seemed as if heaven itself
was about to fight for their enemies. During the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
very night which succeeded the investment of the
city, it was shaken by an earthquake&mdash;the shocks
were repeated during the next day and night&mdash;many
of the houses in the city were shaken down, and the
massive walls of the convent at Bethlehem were
split from top to bottom. The affrighted inhabitants
took refuge in the yards of their falling tenements,
and in the open places of the city; and thus, while
the hills were rocking to and fro, and wailing was
going up from every part of Jerusalem, some of the
enemy found admittance one night, it is said, by
subterranean passages, and these throwing open the
gates, the hordes rushed in, and the place was given
up to pillage and outrage. There were, at that time,
an American, and also an English missionary family,
living in the city. Mrs. Thompson, the wife of the
American missionary, was in feeble health, and had
an infant but a few months old to increase her
anxieties; her husband was absent, and after repeated
but unsuccessful attempts to join her during the
siege, had been compelled to return and wait the
issue at Jaffa. She took refuge with their English
missionary friends, Mr. and Mrs. Nicholayson; and
they had all, at the early part of the war, shut themselves
up in Mr. Nicholayson’s house, subsisting in
a rude way on some grain and dried fruits, which
he had providentially on hand. Mrs. Thompson, in
a letter to her husband, has touchingly described their
situation, the horrors of the earthquake, and their
greater horror when the cries of terror and triumph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
arose on the taking of the city; and when, on the
following morning, they heard the Arabs forcing
their own doors, and soon after met them peering
among the chambers below. Mr. Nicholayson, who
speaks the native language; and understands their
habits well, immediately bribed some of the intruders,
and, by paying them well, engaged a dozen of them
to act as guardians of his house and premises, and
thus saved the families and his effects from injury,
except a few articles which the guardians themselves
took a fancy to and carried off in their subsequent
hasty retreat. Mr. Thompson’s house was stripped,
not a single article escaping their hands. The
Egyptian soldiers who had formed the garrison of
the city took refuge in a strong castle at the Jaffa
gate, which is near Mr. Nicholayson’s dwelling, and
the invaders seizing on all the neighboring houses, a
fire was kept up between the two parties, which I
believe did little injury, except to the houses, some
of which were riddled by the balls from the castle;
among them was that of Mr. Nicholayson, and his
family were once more compelled to take refuge in
the yard. Mrs. Thompson about this time began to
sink under the effects of such repeated alarms, and
of the fatigues and exposure operating on her feeble
health; a violent attack of ophthalmia succeeded,
by which she lost her sight, and was reduced to
extreme feebleness; at length, after much suffering,
borne with meekness, she yielded her spirit with
soothing hope into the hands of Him who gave it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Just previous to her death she was heard to say,
“native, native, native land.” She was a lady of
superior endowments and great excellence of character;
but doubtless, in the hands of a wise Providence,
from this seeming evil good will yet arise.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Pasha, on the first news of this rebellion,
had hastened from Jaffa for the relief of the city; but
he seems to have underrated his enemy, and to have
acted without his usual prudence. The rebels took
post in a narrow pass about seven miles from the
city, and starting suddenly up from amid the steep
and broken ground, poured upon his troops such a
deadly fire, that they broke; and it was only by
hard fighting, and a masterly retreat, that he saved
his army from entire destruction. He retired to
Jaffa, and having, as soon as possible, provided himself
with sufficient force, once more advanced upon
the city. But he found no enemy there. The natives,
the excitement of their first fury now past, and
probably despairing of success against a foe of such
formidable resources, dropped gradually away from
the city; and, with their plunder, retired to the distant
fastnesses of their mountains. They were, however,
not allowed to rest. The Egyptian leader,
binding his field pieces to the backs of camels, crossed
the Jordan in pursuit, and, at the time of our
visit, was ferreting them out, though not without
great risk to himself. He advanced so far that the
communication between him and Jerusalem was for
some time cut off, and serious fears were entertained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for his safety; but he at last succeeded, not only in
subduing, but what was a matter of greater hazard,
in disarming the people. Camel loads of guns and
attaghans or swords were sent to Jerusalem and
Jaffa; and, relentless to the last, he forced from them
the conscripts whom he judged necessary for his
wide and ambitious military schemes. I saw some
of the latter marched into Jaffa one day, between
files of soldiers, and forced into the boats waiting to
convey them on board his fleet, then lying off to receive
them. Poor fellows! they looked heart-broken,
and probably a large portion of them were destined
never again to visit their native hills. A more melancholy
company I think I have never seen; they
dragged themselves along mechanically, without
noticing any one, and some were able to keep on
only by clinging to the garments of those before, or
by being supported by a companion on either side.
After traversing the city they came to the water-gate,
which is a narrow passage between two towers,
and is terminated by a wooden platform six or eight
feet square, and projecting about five feet above the
water. This is the only landing place; the boats
were lying below; and forced along the platform,
they were driven by the point of the bayonet, or
caught by the shoulders and tumbled unceremoniously
into a heap at the bottom of the boat, to extricate
themselves and find a better place as well as
they might be able. In spite of my commiseration,
I could scarcely help smiling at their horror, when,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in turning the angle of the gate-way, they found
themselves in such proximity to the salt water.
Some of them shrank back with all their might; but
it availed them nothing; the boats were successively
filled, and pulling off, presently reached a sand-bar
crossing the road-stead, where they began to plunge
in the breakers;&mdash;then each sought its separate vessel,
and the mountain recruits were swallowed up in
the vortex caused by Mohammed Ali’s wild ambition.</p>

<p>I must now carry the reader back to our own ship,
which he will recollect we left, only yet approaching
the coast. When within a few miles of it, our
motions became cautious, for we knew nothing of
the sea from experience, and our charts and books
gave but little information. The schooner Shark was,
by and by, ordered to approach, and directed to run
in and inquire about the health of the city and the
country adjoining. I got permission, and availed
myself of a boat sent with the flag-lieutenant to her,
determined if I should not be permitted to touch the
Holy Land, at least to have a better view, and to get
as near to it as possible. As we approached the
shore, we saw a boat putting off with our national
ensign, and concluding that it contained the consul,
laid to till it came sufficiently near for parley. His
answer to the first question, “What is the health of
Jaffa and Jerusalem?” produced a sensation of thrilling
joy. “Both enjoyed good health,” he replied,
“and the country was in a state of tolerable quiet.”
So we invited him on board, and right glad he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
seemed to be, to get out of his small vessel and find
himself on board of a larger one. But alas for our
new-fledged joy! The Shark presently got out to
sea, and began to roll and pitch among the waves;
our consul got sea-sick, and we thought frightened
too; and now alarmed us with news that they had
the plague in Jerusalem, and more than half suspected
it to be in Jaffa; that a Frank of distinction
had just died of it in the former place&mdash;that the monasteries
had put themselves in quarantine, and that
for us to venture there, would be highly dangerous
and imprudent. We did not know what to make of
this, but carried him on board the Delaware; and
now, in that large ship, as quiet and as firm as the
solid land, he came to himself, and declared once
more that the country was safe, and the cities
healthy. As night was approaching, we ran out to
sea to avoid the dangerous proximity of the shore;
and though in the morning we were some distance
off, the consul, who had remained on board, still adhered,
I believe, to his last opinion; but the Commodore,
not knowing what to make of him, turned
for information to another source. The Egyptian
fleet cruising here in aid of Ibrahim Pasha, had
come down, and anchored in the evening about a
mile from Jaffa, and the schooner was sent to the
Admiral with Commodore Patterson’s respects, and
with inquiries respecting the health of the cities and
the country between. The result was gratifying;
the Admiral said he had not heard of the plague<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
having been at all at Jerusalem&mdash;that it certainly
was not there now, nor did he know of any other
sickness in the country. The reply was accompanied
with the compliments and offers of service
usual in such intercourse of men of war. He advised
us also to run in till within a mile or a mile and a
half of the shore, and there anchor, as there is a
strong current setting to the northward, and we
might be in danger of getting entangled in some
shoals lying eight or ten miles in that direction.
This we accordingly did; and then, forthwith, began
to make preparations for our long-talked of visit. A
word more, however, about our consul, before he is
dismissed. He accompanied us to Jerusalem, and
was a great annoyance from first to last. The Commodore
had reason from other sources to suppose
him unworthy of his office, and took measures immediately
to have him removed, and another person,
one of merit, to be put in his place; and before
long we had the pleasure of being informed that all
this was done; and Americans who may hereafter
visit Jaffa, will doubtless meet with courteous and
gentlemanly treatment.</p>

<p>Jaffa, to which we made several visits while preparing
for the journey, proved, on closer inspection,
to be a filthy and wretched-looking, place. The
streets were of course narrow, that is common in all
eastern towns; in addition, however, those of Jaffa
go straight up a hill so steep as to require steps cut
in the rock, and as these steps are worn, and often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
slippery and covered with filth, a walk through the
town is one of some labor, and we did not often attempt
it. Indeed there is little to tempt a person to
do so, as the city is not large, and has not a single
building of any importance. I ought to mention
one street as an exception to the general character.
It starts at the water-gate, and stretching along by
the city wall, on the sea shore, is sufficiently level;
on the land side of this are ranges of small warehouses,
which were nearly empty at the time of our
visit, and in no wise abstracted from the dull monotony
of the place. By and by, this street turns
into the city, and beginning to ascend a low eminence,
becomes the principal bazaar, or, I believe I
should say, <em>the</em> bazaar, of the place. The shops
which line it on either side were poorly furnished,
and I found nothing to interest me in the whole bazaar,
except some bunches of grapes. But these <em>did</em>
interest me. One of them I am certain was two feet
in length, not, however, with grapes thickly clustering
along, but scattered at intervals; it was thus not
so remarkable for the quantity of fruit, but for its
length; and I can easily imagine that where such
clusters are common, some of similar length, and
fully charged with fruit, may easily be found. On
my speaking of this cluster to some of the officers,
they told me that they had seen others in the market
still larger.</p>

<p>Along this bazaar I witnessed a scene, the evening
of my return from Jerusalem, which caused the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
place, with all its previous dulness, to leave a pleasing
impression on my mind. Darkness had, on this
occasion, gathered round us, while yet some distance
from the city, and I had been riding on, engaged in
sad musings about the country and its melancholy
history; we crossed at length the open waste between
the gardens and the city, and then passing beneath
the dark archway of the gate, and over its
pavement of loose and slippery stones, I found myself
suddenly amid a group, which conjured up at
once all that I had read in the Arabian Nights. Just
inside this gate is a coffee house, in front of which
the street spreads out into two or three times its
usual width. The place was now all lighted up
with lamps, hung upon pillars, or amid the trellis
work supporting a large grape vine, or to the overhanging
vines themselves; mats were strewed
around, and thickly occupied with groups in the rich
and striking costume of the east; some were sipping
coffee or sherbet, and others engaged with their
pipes; but all were gazing with kindling eyes and
animated features on a man who stood in the midst,
with outstretched arms and great volubility of tongue.
He was an oriental story-teller, and, to judge from
the deep and unusual interest stamped on the features
of his audience, must have been one of quick sagacity
and considerable eloquence. Further on I passed
another company similarly employed.</p>

<p>But though Jaffa may have but little to attract a
stranger, its gardens will have much, particularly if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he happen to be there in the season for its water-melons,
as was the case with us. We had heard a
great deal about the Jaffa watermelons, and our expectations
were so highly raised, that any thing short
of the highest perfection would have disappointed
us. But we were not disappointed. The melons
are not unusually large, but of a richness and delicacy
which, I believe, is no where surpassed, if it
can be equalled. Some of our officers thought they
had sometimes met with as good melons at home,
but most of them were decided in the preference for
those from the Jaffa gardens.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> These gardens
commence a few hundred yards from the walls of the
city, and are from a quarter to half a mile in length;
the soil is almost a pure sand, and seems incapable
of producing any thing at all; but wherever watered,
rewards the labor of the operator with abundance of
fruits and vegetables of the greatest variety. Pomegranates
here are in the highest perfection, and the
cactus, or prickly pear, grows to the height of twelve
or fifteen feet; along the road to Jerusalem it forms
a hedge for the gardens, and a most effectual one it
is. Its fruit grows on the edge of the leaf, and in
these countries is oval in shape, and about three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
inches in length; it is full of seeds, but is cooling and
refreshing, and has, to me, an agreeable taste. Back
of the gardens of Jaffa, the country is generally
open and deserted; but in spots it is cultivated, and
appears to be sufficiently productive.</p>

indeed. The visit had been a subject of pleasing
anticipation from the beginning of the cruise, and a
disappointment here would have cast a damp upon
all our other pleasures. But here we were at last,
ashore at Jaffa, mounted and ready to be off; every
face cheerful, and our hearts swelling with expected
enjoyment. We wound through the low bazaar,
and then slipping and stumbling over the execrable
pavement of the gateway, found ourselves out in the
country, and fairly on our way. And here we turned
to look at each other, and enjoy the oddity and grotesqueness
of the scene. We were, indeed, a curious
looking set of pilgrims. As we arrived ashore, there
was a general scrambling for the animals, which, by
orders of the governor of Jaffa, had been brought in
from the country for the occasion; and as these included
every variety, and there was little time for
choosing, it was amusing to see the mal-agreement
which often occurred between man and beast. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
stout and heavy man might be seen sweating and
toiling along on the back of one of the most diminutive
of donkeys; a graceful cavalier, who prided himself
on his horsemanship, and had selected what
appeared to be a fine-looking Arab, found himself on
an asthmatic animal, which neither whip nor the
pins stuck into his boots for lack of spurs, could
force from a sluggish walk. Then came along a
young midshipman, on a streak of lightning, clinging
to the mane or saddle, and agape to find himself
in a situation where his superior officers, and even
the Commodore, were glad to yield the deck to him.
His horse, brought up on the wild hills, is unconscious
how sadly he is violating naval etiquette; and
away they go, till a turn in the road hides them from
our sight. “Give my Jack a punch,” cries one,
“the nasty beast, I can’t get him to move;” while at
the act, Jack suddenly finds the use of his hinder
quarters, and the puncher, from being a grave-looking
personage, suddenly takes to hopping and singing,
and working his features into the oddest grimace.
Some of our company had no animals at
all, and others were debating whether they had not
better leave those they had; while the animals themselves
stood straight up to second the motion.
My friend M&mdash;&mdash;, thinking perhaps that necessity
hath no law, stepped up coolly to a horse fastened
to a bit of shrubbery, and having loosed him, and
thrown his Turkey rug over the saddle, seated himself
on the top of it; concluding, with good reason,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that the owner would soon be after him, and that he
could then, perhaps, make a bargain for the beast.
It turned out that the horse belonged to a soldier
going our way, and who, on promise of a <i lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">bakshish</i>,
or present, agreed to this impudent arrangement;
but the next morning horse and soldier were missing,
and with them the fine, large Turkey rug,&mdash;showing
how universally we may apply the counsel,
“set a rogue to catch a rogue.”</p>

<p>Amid this scene of confusion, the general attention
was directed to the family group at the head of the
party, a group respected and beloved by all of us; and
it was gratifying, in the cheerful looks of the ladies, to
find that they were rather amused than dismayed
by the necessary discomforts of this new kind of
travelling. We got, by and by, into pretty good
order, and moved cheerily on. Our company consisted
of the Commodore, lady, and three daughters,
the consul and lady, thirty-six lieutenants, midshipmen,
&amp;c., twelve petty officers and servants; and
muleteers in addition sufficient to make a party in
all, of more than seventy persons.</p>

<p>Nearly every individual was armed, and our warlike
accoutrements, as well as the rest of our fitting
out, had a broad dash of the picturesque.</p>

<p>While we were getting ready for a move, an old seaman
came up to me, and begged hard that I would
get him permission to accompany us. “Why,
W&mdash;&mdash;,” I replied, “I don’t see what reason I can give
for it that fifty others might not urge, and besides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
you have no donkey&mdash;you see every thing with four
legs to it is already taken up.” “Oh,” he replied,
“ask to allow me to walk by &mdash;&mdash; and take care of
the sedan; and as to a donkey, I don’t need one, I
am willing to walk all the way.” I succeeded in
the application, and had forgotten the circumstance,
till one day, eighteen months after, when the crew
had been discharged, W&mdash;&mdash; came up to me on the
wharf at Norfolk, and, taking my hand, said I had
conferred a favor on him which he would remember
to the last day of his life. I asked him what it was:
“Oh,” he replied, “you got me permission to go to
Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>When I returned from the Holy City, I brought
back a quantity of olive root from the Mount of Olives,
and giving it to the carpenter on board ship to saw
it up, on going to the bench, I found the seamen
around, catching the sawdust, and picking the earth
from the holes among the roots. So strong was the
feeling of interest with which the proximity of the
city had inspired us.</p>

<p>It may be supposed, then, that we wound along
among the gardens of Jaffa with cheerful alacrity.
The road is sandy and toilsome, but is bordered with
shrubbery interwoven with the huge cactus, and gay
flowers were pendant on every side. We had left
the city at 4 P. M.; and the sun, now throwing its
rays slantingly among the blossoms and foliage, gave
them their richest effect. About a mile from the walls
we came to a Turkish fountain, about twenty feet in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
height, and highly ornamented. The road bends at
this place, and soon after ascends a range of low
hills, where cultivation ceases, and the traveller finds
himself in the open country, without enclosure or
habitation in sight.</p>

<p>A number of the European consuls, and other
gentlemen resident in Jaffa, had done us the honor
to accompany us thus far. They were mounted on
fine spirited Arabs, and now driving the shovel-shaped
stirrup into their horses’ sides, flew up the
hill side, and at length, brought at the summit in bold
relief against the sky, they formed a picture such as
is seen only in these glowing eastern countries.
They wore the native costume, presenting a variety
of brilliant and fanciful colors; and in this case the
dress was perfectly clean, and evidently put on with
careful and studied effect. Having presently reached
a level piece of ground, they scattered, and commenced
the djerid, a play in which the Arabs greatly
delight, and which is adapted to bring out the powers
both of horse and rider, and show them to fine
advantage. Each horseman is furnished with a
stick of some tough material, four or five feet
in length, and of the thickness of the middle finger;
they divide about equally, and each selecting an opponent,
the effort is to strike the adversary with the
rod. In doing this they pursue each other at the
top of the horse’s speed, often bring him to a halt so
suddenly as to throw him on his haunches, whirl
at an instant’s warning, hang by the leg and arm so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
as to avoid the whizzing rod, catch it in the air, or,
while the horse is at full speed, snatch it from the
ground, and turning, become the pursuer till the rod
is discharged, or the adversary has again recovered
one in his turn. It is an exciting and highly animated
sport, and was kept up on the large plain, now
on our right, now on the left, till one or two of the
company became provoked by some well-dealt
blows, and the play began to look serious; while a
few showed by their soiled dresses that they had
come in closer contact with the ground than was
pleasant. Kind feeling was, however, soon restored
by some smart hits in return, and the play wound
up in good-humor; after which, our Arab guide,
with his long, slender spear, once more putting himself
at the head of our party, our friends wheeled
their steeds, and having made a graceful salaam,
darted over the hill on their return to Jaffa, and
were soon out of sight.</p>

<p>We were now fairly on the celebrated <em>Plain of
Sharon</em>; but times have sadly changed, and we
might have looked in vain for roses or any other
shrub. The road laid through a country not absolutely
flat, and yet scarcely undulating; with scarcely
a tree, and no where presenting any sign of cultivation.
Towards sunset, however, we found ourselves
approaching an olive grove, beyond which, on
our left, was a wretched looking village of ten or a
dozen houses; also a ruin of large dimensions, which
we had not time to examine. Beyond this the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
assumed the same open and deserted appearance;
and, except a fountain which we passed a few
miles onward, there was nothing to show that it was
the habitation of men. Darkness, by and by, began
to fall around us, we drew our company into a more
compact form, and having examined our arms, passed
on in silence; a spirit of sadness and musing, excited
probably by the melancholy nature of the
country, having apparently seized on the whole of
our party.</p>

<p>We were now in what was formerly the territory
of the tribe of Dan, their possessions, I believe, having
extended from the sea inward to a distance of
thirty miles, and about twelve from north to south.
Of Dan, it was said by his father Jacob, that he was
“a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth
the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall back.”
And the position which long afterwards fell by lot
to this tribe, appears to have been adapted to produce
or to cherish such a trait of character.</p>

<p>Two thirds of the great highway from Jerusalem
to its sea-port Joppa, laid through their territory; and
the long winding ravine by which this road ascends
from the plain of Sharon into the mountainous region
that encircles Jerusalem, affords admirable facilities
for plundering. Until very recently, the upper
extremity of this ravine was occupied by Aboo
Ghoosh, at the head of a set of daring fellows,
who regularly laid contributions on travellers; while
a village near the other extremity bore no better reputation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Dr. Clarke’s baggage was seized upon,
and carried to the latter town, where he had great
difficulty in recovering it; and, more recently, the
French traveller, De la Martine, found it prudent by
judicious means to secure in season the good favor
of Aboo Ghoosh. This robber-chief, whose power
extended over a large tract of country, and was well
systematized, has recently been appointed by the
Pasha of Egypt to a high office in Jerusalem; and
we saw him on our visit enthroned in his new state,
where he seems ill at ease. Mohammed Ali has
thus removed a nuisance and secured a powerful
friend; but it is not probable that his robber-propensities
will be greatly checked by these new dignities.</p>

<p>When shall this desert region rejoice and blossom
as the rose, and when shall we be able to speak of
“the excellency of Carmel and Sharon?”&mdash;“The
highways” now “lie waste, and the wayfaring man
ceaseth; Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down, and
Sharon is like a wilderness.”&mdash;Though it is sad to
look at a plain like this of Sharon, about eighty
miles in length by twenty in width, and of <a id="Ref_153" href="#RRef_153">extensive</a>
fertility, and bordering also on the sea, yet now
little more than a desert waste; though sad, there is
nothing very remarkable in it, for it is the character
of many such plains in Asia; but there is something
very remarkable when we think of this country in
connexion with the strange people whose father-land
it is, a people who are over the whole face
of our globe, an astonishment, a proverb, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by-word; turning ever with warm desires towards
the home of their fathers; yet still “scattered among
all people, from one end of the earth to the other,”
and among them finding no ease nor rest, but distressed
“with a trembling heart and failing of eyes,
and sorrow of mind”&mdash;outcasts every where, the
“heaven over their head is brass, and the earth under
their feet is iron.” I do not see how a man can read
the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy, and be satisfied
that it was written at the time it purports to be, and
yet remain an infidel; and that it was written at
that time, is a matter capable of very easy proof. I
have seen the Jews in a great many countries; and
if we were to sit down to describe their condition,
we could not find terms to express it more accurately
than is done in that chapter, penned 3287 years ago.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock we discovered lights ahead,
and heard the barking of dogs, and soon after entered
Ramla, the ancient Arimathea, which was to be our
stopping-place for the night. Here, to our surprise,
we found also an agent of our government, a vice-consul
appointed by the consul at Jaffa, to whom, I
believe, he had paid a consideration for the office.
He was an Armenian gentleman, apparently wealthy,
and certainly kind and hospitable. Our arrival had
been expected, and every thing grateful to hungry
and wearied pilgrims had been provided. Tables
were loaded with fowls and mutton, and with the
delicious water-melons of Jaffa, as well as abundance
of other fruits, and with wine. When our large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
company had all been fed, such conveniences as the
house afforded for sleeping were freely given up to
us; our host all the while sitting unobtrusively at
one side of the eating room, and seldom speaking,
except to order additional supplies of refreshments.
However, Mon. Damon, the consul at Jaffa, who
with his lady had come with us, in order that the
credit for the entertainment might not be lost, took
it all to himself; bustling about, and telling us that
the house was his own, that he had provided the
feast, and bidding us welcome. I am happy to be
able to add, that through the influence of Commodore
Patterson, this gentleman, Mr. Marcus Abers,
has since received an appointment independent of
the consulate at Jaffa. We received, with the freedom
of sailors, what was so freely and generously
offered; and when, in the morning, our caterer, after
some hesitation on the score of delicacy, offered remuneration,
as the company was so large and miscellaneous,
it was declined, and the party was cordially
invited to repeat the visit on our return.</p>

<p>Ramla has at present little to detain a traveller,
though it was formerly a city of considerable dimensions;
its population now is about 3,000, principally
Mahommedans and Christians of the Greek church.
At the borders on the western side, <a id="Ref_155" href="#RRef_155">thirty miles from
Jerusalem</a>, are some vast subterranean apartments
belonging to the ancient times of the city. One is
one hundred and fifty feet long by forty in width,
and is twenty-five feet deep; the second and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
third are each seventy feet square, and of the same
depth as the former. Adjoining the second, is a
tower twenty-five feet square, and still one hundred
feet in height, and a conspicuous object at a great
distance on the plain. Our time did not admit of a
visit to these ruins, and for the dimensions I am indebted
to Mr. Thompson, by whom they have been
described. Mr. Thompson was at Ramla during
the recent earthquake, and heard a debate on its
causes by the learned men of the city; The Cadi,
or Judge, spoke at last, and with gravity suitable to
his high station, gave his solution of the phenomenon.
“The earth,” he said, “has seven foundations; the
first, water; second, air; third, a mountain; fourth,
a cushion; fifth, (Mr. T. does not recollect;) sixth,
a great rock; and seventh, the horn of the great ox.
When the ox becomes fatigued, he changes the rock
from one horn to the other, and that caused the
shaking.”</p>

<p>After some slight refreshment, at an early hour on
the 16th we resumed our journey, and soon found
ourselves once more breathing the country air. We
passed some ruins on our right just after leaving the
city, and also, soon after this, a company of about
200 cavalry at drill on the plain. Our road, I ought
to have remarked before this, was not directly across
the plain, but in a slanting direction, Jerusalem
being situated a little to the south of east from Jaffa.
The distance from Ramla is thirty miles. We descended
two or three steep banks, separated from each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
other by intervals of several miles, and thus arrived,
at length, at the lowest level of the plain, which appears
to consist of this level, and, on the west of it, of a
succession of terraces, each about forty feet in height,
and three or four miles in width. The country,
during our morning ride, was not of so melancholy
a cast as on the day previous, patches of millet or
indian corn occurring here and there, with other
signs of cultivation; but the sun now beat upon us
with scorching power. About ten o’clock we passed a
miserable village close on our left, and an hour after,
a cone-shaped eminence on our right, with some
ruins, supposed to be the remains of Beth-Horon,
noticed in 2 Chron. viii. 5. 1 Samuel, xiii. 18.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The hill is about 400 feet in height, and in most
parts is of difficult ascent; it was well adapted for
defence, and the extensive and massive ruins on the
top show that it was a place of considerable strength.
This was probably the <em>upper</em> city: for the site of
the “Nether-Beth-Horon,” we must look among the
broken ground that skirts the lower part of the eminence.
This was a place of importance, as it commands
the entrance of the winding ravine, along
which the road ascends from the plain into the
mountainous district, or what is called in the first
chapter of John, the “hill country” of Judea.</p>

<p>The entrance into this ravine is about two miles
east from Beth-Horon; and as it stood gaping before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
us, with the mountains on either side towering to a
great height, while the representations of travellers
had led us to expect beyond it only mountains, still
darker and more dreary, we turned some reluctant
looks backward towards the plain. The roads over
these mountains we had been also informed by Mr.
Damon, were the worst possible; but in this latter respect
we were to meet with an agreeable disappointment.
One of the consuls at Jaffa, a merchant, (I
believe the Sardinian consul,) in order to divert the
trade of the Mecca and Jerusalem caravans from Damascus
to his own city, had lately put the road in
excellent order. In many places he had blasted
rocks, and at others had built up walls; the operation
had been an expensive one, and the enterprise
of the gentleman merits a better reward than I am
afraid it will receive.</p>

<p>As we were entering the ravine, we met a company
of Egyptian soldiers; and, further on, in a narrow
part, encountered a much larger force, returning
to the west. They had with them a great number
of camels loaded with baggage and accoutrements,
and often with field-pieces, some of the latter (brass
six pounders) being lashed to spars which were
fastened to the backs of two camels, one before the
other. The soldiers, though the balance of power
was greatly on their side, were very civil; and in no
instance showed a disposition to offer annoyance, or
give us unnecessary trouble. It was in this pass that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the Roman army, under Cestius, were almost totally
destroyed.</p>

<p>We found the ascent up to the ravine, though long,
yet far from being toilsome. At the summit, at a
spot commanding a view of all the plain of Sharon
and the sea beyond, we stopped in an olive grove for
dinner. This was near the village of the ex-robber,
prince Aboo Ghoosh; but a change has come over
the country under the sovereignty of Mohammed
Ali, for the people did not even come to look at us.</p>

<p>Descending again, we passed, at the bottom of a
valley, a village, on the borders of which is a large
church belonging to the time of the crusades. A
more desolate scene than presented itself as we
wound up the hills beyond this village cannot be
easily imagined. The rocks in all this region are
secondary limestone, and the hills, consequently, are
rounded, presenting few bold peaks or precipitous
ridges; but all was gray rock from the bottom to the
summit, and the senses became pained by the gloomy
monotony of the scene, a wide and dreary waste of bare
rocks. By and by, descending again, we found ourselves
in a valley watered by a rivulet, and with some
fields and a vineyard; but soon plunged again into the
same succession of bare rocky hills, where not a tree
nor shrub was to be seen, and not a living thing,
except a bird now and then <a id="Ref_159" href="#RRef_159">whirling</a> in its solitary
flight. A steep descent brought us at length into the
narrow defile where occurred the battle between
Ibrahim Pasha and the rebels already noticed; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
skeletons of horses were still scattered, by the road
side. This pass is also a favorite haunt of robbers; particularly
at a spot where a bridge crosses a dry channel
which winds through the bottom of the valley.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Siste
viator.</i> This channel, now dry, but covered
by a considerable stream in winter, is that from
which David selected pebbles for his sling when
going to meet <a id="Ref_160"></a>Goliath; I believe, however, this event
occurred some distance further down. We passed
this bridge on our return an hour before daylight;
and, as we approached, an officer of the Pasha’s
household who accompanied us, made the party halt
and form into compact order; and then had the
bridge reconnoitred before he allowed us to proceed.
There was no one there, but further on, at the battle
ground, a strange horseman rode up and passed us
several times, as if scrutinizing our company, and
others were seen on the other side of the glen; but
apparently they did not like our equipment, as they
gave us no further trouble.</p>

<p>Having crossed this bridge, we were now in constant
expectation of getting sight of Jerusalem; and
as we approached the summit of a long hill, our
caterer, Lieutenant S&mdash;&mdash;, made the officers in the
van fall back, so that Mrs. Patterson might be the
first to advance and catch a view of the sacred city.
But we were to be disappointed; it was not in sight,
and these disappointments occurred so often, that at
length we grew less earnest in our look out ahead.
Evening was fast approaching, and just as distant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
objects were beginning to grow indistinct, a sudden
rise on the road brought to view some white buildings
far off, and a little to our left. A sudden cry of
“Jerusalem” burst from the foremost, and all hurried
forward to enjoy the welcome sight; again, however,
we were mistaken. But, a few minutes after this,
while we were gazing at the objects just described,
and debating whether they were the sacred city or not,
a long white wall, with battlements and towers, presented
itself suddenly right before us; and then arose
a general cry of joyful surprise&mdash;<em>for this we knew
to be Jerusalem</em>. I believe there was not one of us
who was not affected with powerful emotions; and
among these feelings was generally a sensation of
pleasing surprise at the imposing appearance of the
city; for whether it was owing to its contrast to the
small group of houses we had been looking at, or to
the manner in which it bursts upon us in a dreary
desert, or whether there was sufficient cause for this
in the city itself, I cannot say; but the first impression
was certainly a very favorable one.</p>

<p>The city, as viewed from the west, presents a
stretch of wall about two thirds of a mile in length,
battlemented and strengthened with numerous towers,
and, at the Jaffa gate, which is midway along, fortified
with heavy castles. South of this gate, the walls stand
on the edge of a ravine or valley sixty feet in depth
and two hundred feet wide, and at this part, particularly,
the effect is very bold and striking. As we approached,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
battlement and turret were here thrown
out into strong relief against the clear evening sky.</p>

<p>This was our first view and first impression of Jerusalem.
To myself, however, little time was given
for observation. The Commodore called for me;
and telling me that as this was a city in the line of
my profession, they must look to me to provide
quarters for the company&mdash;said he wished me to
ride forward rapidly, and see where we could find
accommodations. So I changed my humble donkey
for a spirited steed, and taking for interpreter a
young Arab officer who had accompanied us from
Jaffa, set forward at a pace that made us look more
like crusading knights at a tilt than peaceable pilgrims.
The gates, which are usually closed at sunset,
we found were kept open in expectation of the
arrival of our party, and a large number of citizens
were standing in groups without. On our drawing
up and inquiring the way to the house of Mr. Nicholayson,
the missionary from England, he himself stept
forward and gave us a hearty welcome. His house
he immediately placed at our disposal, but on his inquiring
how many there might be in the party, and
receiving my answer, “I think about seventy,” he
stood aghast. A company of seven or a dozen, the
number as he had supposed our company, he could
readily accommodate, and his house was cordially
at our service for as many as it would hold; but
where to find accommodations for seventy he could
not tell, some of the monasteries, the usual resort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of pilgrims, being now, he said, in quarantine on account
of the plague. We turned into the city, however,
to make an effort; and crossing an irregular
open area, and then winding down some dark narrow
streets, stopped at length at a low gate in the
face of a high massy wall. It admitted us into the
chief Latin convent; but the Prior, on our being
presented, said that nearly all the building was in
quarantine, some of the monks having recently died
of the plague, and that an adjacent establishment belonging
to his order was in a similar situation.
Foiled here, we proceeded on a little further, and on
applying, though with reluctance, at the Greek convent,
were successful; their large building, forming
a hollow square with a court in the centre, being
given up to us. We returned forthwith, and found
that our company had already entered the city, and in
attempting to follow us, had got jammed up in one
of the narrow streets, where a scene of vexatious and
yet amusing confusion was just commencing; the
baggage mules with their broad panniers and projecting
loads sticking fast between the opposite
houses, and, in their efforts to extricate themselves,
taking little note of rank or office; while torches
glancing here and there upon pistol and cutlass, and
the dusty, and jaded, and sometimes disconsolate
looking features of our companions, mixed up with
the wild and curious gaze of the natives, assisted in
making up a singular scene. They had just learned
the result of our application at the Latin convent;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and to a wearied man, the idea of passing the night
in such rough and odoriferous streets as these, could
not be a pleasing one. They were highly gratified
to find that we had at length been able to procure
quarters. The Commodore and his family were invited
to the house of Mr. Nicholayson, where, among
the kind and agreeable members of his family, they
soon found themselves in a pleasant home; while
the rest of us, passing through the low strong portal
of the convent, and emerging by and by from the
dark narrow passage, into the enclosed court, turned
to see what species of accommodation we were to
have. The prospect seemed melancholy enough.
Around the court was a range of buildings, three
fourths of which were given up to us, the remaining
fourth being occupied by the Prior’s rooms and
offices of the church, and by the church itself. The
lower part of our portion of the edifice was occupied
as stables, kitchen, granary, &amp;c.; and gave also accommodation
to some of our party. Ascending from
this by a large stairway, we entered on a platform
passing around three sides of the court, with a parapet
along its interior edge, while on its opposite
border was a range of cells, which we found on inquiry
were to be our dormitories. Tired as we were,
we recoiled from the sight of them. They were
usually about eight or nine feet square, and so low
that a person could scarcely stand upright in them;
a broken door, a hole for a window, a stone or
mortar floor, and a thin reed mat, and dust in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
greatest abundance&mdash;this was the sight that presented
itself as we came to examine our domicils. Some
joked, some took it all in quiet, and some said “it
was really too bad.” But uncomfortable as these
abodes appeared to us, other creatures did not seem
to think them so, for they were really well tenanted;
and when our lights were extinguished, and we had
wrapped ourselves each in his blanket, and had
stretched ourselves on the stone floor, we soon discovered
how far from solitary was the life of our friends
the monks. Our chambers were alive with lilliputians,
which immediately commenced an attack on us.
As D., and S., and myself, were lying in our little
room, we first heard some notes of distress on the
outside, and occasionally an exclamation of “Hollo,
are you out here too?” and then there was a general
cry&mdash;“I can’t bear this any longer;” and we rushed
out to the platform to which we found every cell
ejecting its inmates. We did not get asleep until
nature, towards morning, was absolutely worn out,
when the fleas, having worried us into utter exhaustion,
were allowed to gorge themselves at their
leisure. The reader may perhaps think that I might
have spared him this scene, which is not a pleasant
one, and must jar on the feelings of one who would
come with other sensations, and be occupied with
other thoughts, in this city of solemn and touching
associations; but my impression is, that he would
like to see the modern city as it is, and I wish also,
as far as possible, to make him also a traveller, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
carry him along with us; this is no exaggerated picture
of our first night, and may be taken as a sample
of the rest. Jerusalem, however, is not alone in this;
but the whole of this region, from the cataracts of
the Nile to Constantinople, is teeming with fleas.
We thought, however, that this city was peculiarly
infested with them, and were informed that in the
most cleanly houses, no care could keep any part
of the building free from them.</p>

<p>The night passed away at length, and ushered in
a brilliant dawn, such as is not often seen except in
these eastern countries, where the thin and scanty
exhalations are just sufficient, without obscuring
any portions of the landscape, to tinge all with roseate
and purple hues.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Morning view of the city. Glance at the localities. Question with
regard to the place of the Crucifixion. Its practical nature. Scene
usually sketched in the mind. The event probably more humiliating
in its attendant circumstances. Traditions forced upon the visitor
to Jerusalem. Their effect on the mind. Danger of such visits
to those who will not separate truth from error. “El Devoto
Peregrino.” Dr. Clarke.</p>

<p>I arose early on the morning of the 16th; the
sun was shining bright, and the atmosphere had a
freshness and a balminess quite exhilarating. Having
made a hasty toilet, I placed a ladder against our range
of cells, and climbing to the flat roof, by which they
were covered, gazed around; and now, for the first
time, felt that I was really in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Immediately east of the city, and separated from it
by a narrow valley or ravine, was a mountain large
enough to command our respect by its vastness, and
yet not too large for gracefulness and beauty. I
knew it at once to be the <em>Mount of Olives</em>. It has
three summits, one in the centre and one at each
extremity; they are of nearly equal height, and when
viewed from the city present for their outline a
gentle and beautiful curve. A large part of it is
covered with olive trees, particularly the central and
northern summits and declivities; and they still form
so striking a feature, that if the mountain were now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to be named, we should be apt to call it the Mount of
Olives.</p>

<p>Nearer to me, and just within the city walls, on
the east, was a large open place, and from the centre
of this rose an octangular edifice of considerable
beauty; I had seen pictures of it, and recognized it
as the mosque of Omar, standing on the supposed
site of the Temple of Solomon. There at least was
undoubtedly Mount Moriah, and my own eyes were
gazing upon it.</p>

<p>I turned from it soon, however, to look for a spot
of still more absorbing interest. Where was Mount
Calvary? Not far from me rose two domes, one
somewhat peaked, the other one more obtuse, but
very large. In all directions, however, were domes
of various sizes, and the mind was puzzled, though
still arrested by the position as well as the magnitude
of these two. A couple of old and venerable
looking monks were hanging over the parapet of a
neighboring convent watching my motions, and
turning to inquire of them, I found my surmise had
been correct. This was the church of Mount Calvary
and of the Holy Sepulchre.&mdash;“Put off thy shoes
from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is
holy ground.”&mdash;“At least,” a voice seemed to say to
me, “walk here with seriousness and humility; bow
thy head, and cleanse thy heart, and tread with
meekness the ground trod by Him who was here
humbled for thee, and here bore thy sins upon the
cross.” It was the Sabbath also&mdash;this first day of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
our visit; and the quiet and healthful influence of
that holy season was added to the power which
Jerusalem would at any time have exercised upon
the heart.</p>

<p>I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Imagination
in its highest flights has not pictured a scene
that will compare in interest, or in deep and searching
pathos, with the reality here displayed in the redemption
of man. It partakes of the character of
all the works of God, combining a simplicity that
opens it to the comprehension of all men, with a
grandeur and sublimity that must excite the admiration
of the highest seraphim. I have seen it where
I have seen man’s proud philosophy quail and shrink
into nothingness&mdash;in the sick room and by the dying
bed; I have seen it come gently and quietly, and
open the feeble lips in praise, and in utterance of
joyful and triumphant hope. I have seen it sustain
and cheer those whom the world, and the world’s
enjoyments and earthly hopes too, had all deserted,
and who would otherwise have been left in maddening
solitude and wretchedness; I have seen it sustain
them; and while the body was tortured with
pains, I have seen it raise the mind superior to bodily
feeling, and while the cold sweat was breaking out
upon the brow, keep that brow calm and serene.
The tortured child of clay thought of his Saviour’s
humiliation and pains, and of the glory wrought out
for him; and, in the boundless love that led to the
sufferings of Calvary, found assurance that God was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
even now a friend closer than a brother, and would
not desert him to the last. “I am not ashamed of
the gospel of Christ crucified, for it is the power of
God unto salvation to every one that believeth;”&mdash;and
the highest honor of my life was on that day,
when I was permitted to walk amid scenes dignified
and exalted by the great events of our redemption.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a day of concentrated interest and
gratification, such as I had never experienced before,
and do not expect ever to feel again. After breakfast
our large Company broke up into smaller parties,
and proceeded to visit the various localities. In company
with Lieutenant F. I walked over to Mr.
Nicholayson’s, and, under the guidance of that gentleman,
we went, with the Commodore and family,
first to the church of Mount Calvary and of the Holy
Sepulchre.</p>

<p>But is this church really on the site of the crucifixion,
and of the sepulture of our Saviour? This
is a question which it may be well to settle before
proceeding further, so that we may know with what
feelings to approach spots of such sacred and interesting
titles. It is a subject on which my own mind
is satisfied almost beyond a doubt, and if the reader
will for a short time give me patient attention, in a
somewhat dry and difficult examination of facts, I
think he may find himself rewarded for his labor.
It is true that the question with regard to the exact
<em>locality</em> of these events is of little consequence, compared
with the great subject of the redemption itself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and the query whether we have, by a living faith,
made that salvation ours; but still it is one not without
its practical consequences. The mind often tries
to picture the scene of the Saviour’s sufferings, the
uplifted bloody cross, the hours of agony, the tumultuous
crowds of scoffers below; and our feelings are
touched, and the heart is benefitted, by contemplating
the price that was paid for our salvation, the obligations
under which we are placed by it, and the
assurance it gives us of the surpassing love of Him
who spared not his own Son, but gave him freely
for us; the whole scene is often one of pious thought
and of pulpit description, and has frequently enlisted
the skill of painters, and is a matter of practical interest.
My impression is, that the scene we sketch
is very seldom correct, and that the event itself had
a depth of humiliation that our thoughts do not
reach; and in this I do not have reference to the
condescension of the sufferer, but to circumstances
connected with the locality of the suffering. Our
thoughts, when they turn to this subject, I believe
place before us an eminence of considerable elevation,
sloping gradually upward, and crowned at the
summit by the crosses of our Saviour and the malefactors,
while the slopes are all crowded with the
excited spectators. This, I believe, is the picture that is
generally presented to our mind; and there is in it a
degree of physical dignity, that the event itself, I am
inclined to think, did not possess. On the other
hand, if my apprehensions are correct, the crucifixion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
was attended with every physical circumstance
that could make it humbling as well as painful;
instead of being on the summit of a lofty eminence,
it was on a rocky knoll at the bottom of a
natural theatre of hills; on one side, at the distance
of five hundred feet, was the city wall; on another,
the low and wretched suburb of a suburb; it was in
an open place, with dusty roads to various parts of
the city passing near it; a thoroughfare, in short,
where the spectacle of dust and confusion was broken
only by a few gardens, the remains of a larger range
of such enclosures, now nearly destroyed by the encroaching
suburb.</p>

<p>Such is the scene which the result of my investigations,
commenced there, and followed up since my
return, places before me. I examined the ground
in and about the city as carefully as my time would
allow, and with the aid of Josephus, <a href="#Jerusalem_map">have constructed
a map</a>, which is here offered to the examination
of the reader. In my younger days, I used to take
great interest in maps of Jerusalem, till, finding that
each differed from every other one, and that they
were filled with the localities of public buildings,
some of them evidently placed at random, I lost in a
measure my confidence in all the plans, and as they
furnished me with no means of judging for myself, I
gave them up in despair; and this is probably the
case with many other persons.</p>

<div id="Jerusalem_map" class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="379" height="650" alt="Map of Jerusalem" />
</div>

<p>In this map I have laid down nothing for which
we have not authority, and I have in every part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
quoted the authorities; so that, if the reader chooses,
he can examine and form an opinion for himself.
He will find that I have been guided chiefly by
Josephus, whose descriptions of the ancient city are,
undoubtedly, by far the most correct as well as the
most minute that we possess.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> If I have not rightly
understood them, it has not been from the want of
study. I have read him carefully, and compared one
part with another, and have seized on every allusion to
localities, and have again and again studied and
compared, and did not stop till I had a map that
would correspond to all such descriptions and allusions.
He is, I think, deserving of our confidence;
for he spent much time in and about the ancient city;
his duties as an officer in Titus’ army led him to
examine, and as far as possible to get the admeasurements
of its walls and towers; he must at this time
have been preparing for his work on the Jewish nation,
and probably made his records on the ground; and
with a little allowance for the pride and prejudices of
a Jew, as regards his country, seems to be a fair and
candid narrator of events, a large part of which fell
under his own observation. In some places he is
obscure, and at times appears to contradict himself;
but a little study will enable us to understand and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
reconcile most of these passages; in many parts, particularly
in scenes of pathos, there is a simplicity and
yet a force, in his descriptions, that are really admirable.</p>

<p>In the map<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> just spoken of, I have sketched also
the line of the present city walls, as I found it could
be done without producing confusion, and I thought
the reader would like to be able to see how much of
the ground of the ancient city is occupied by the
modern Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>The traveller to the present city, at least the Protestant
traveller, is excessively annoyed at every
step with traditions in which he cannot believe, and
with having localities pointed out in which he can
place no confidence whatever; and the effect is bad
in a great many ways. It not only disturbs sadly
the feelings with which he would wish to walk over
the grounds of Jerusalem, but, sickened and disgusted,
he is apt to run into the opposite extreme of incredulity,
and reject even where there is proper
grounds for belief. I have now before me large extracts
which I made from a book called El Devoto
Peregrino, or “The Devout Pilgrim,” published at
Madrid in 1654, by P. F. Antonio of Castile, Commissary
General of Jerusalem for Spain, and Guardian of
Bethlehem,<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in the last of which places he had spent
a number of years. It offers a good specimen of the
accounts of places that are thrust on the visitor to
Jerusalem, and as it is a book of high authority, I
will by and by give some of the extracts at length.
In this work he points out edifices, at present standing,
and which it must be evident are comparatively
modern structures, as the houses of Pilate, of Simon
the Pharisee, where Mary Magdalene washed our Saviour’s
feet with her tears, of St. Ann, of the Rich
Man, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and this in the face of authentic history,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
which informs us that the city, when taken by
Titus, was, with the exception of a few towers, levelled
with the ground, and that a ploughshare was
made to pass over it. There is scarcely an event of
any description, mentioned in the New Testament
as occurring in or about Jerusalem, of which they
do not designate the exact locality; and to all this
they have added traditions so absurd as to be beyond
all belief, to say nothing of their childishness. All
this is repeated to the visitor to Jerusalem, and produce
a revulsion of feeling not only disagreeable but
dangerous; and men whose faith is not previously
settled, or who do not like the trouble of sifting the
truth from error, I believe would be apt to be injured
by such a visit. And it appears to me that most
Protestant visitors, and our missionaries also, have
been betrayed by these feelings into an excess of
scepticism, which has led them to reject some things
against sound and proper evidence. We must not
reject all because some is false, any more than we
would reject all species of coin because some is spurious;
a wise man will be led by the fact that there
is spurious money, to believe that there is good
money some where; and therefore, these tales, instead
of provoking utter scepticism, while they make us
cautious, should at the same time lead us to suppose
that there <em>is</em> ground for belief.</p>

<p>Dr. Clark is the boldest of these modern sceptics;
for while others simply doubt, he goes further, and
with a feeling bordering certainly on rashness, attempts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
at once to designate other sites for these distinguished
events. His boldness is not more surprising
than is the small amount of evidence he produces
for his localities; and I believe he has had scarcely
a single follower, among either readers at home, or
travellers to these interesting spots. As he stands
quite alone, the subject of wonder rather than of
credence, we will not stop to examine his theories;
but proceed to notice the old belief, and the doubts
of more cautious and moderate men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Localities in Jerusalem that are certain. Valley of Kedron. Mount
Moriah. Valley of the Cheesemongers. Mount Zion, its ancient
limits. Present remains of its northern boundary. Line of the
“Old wall.” Acra. Gate of the Gardens. Limits of the city at the
time of the crucifixion. Bezetha and the wall of Agrippa. Monument
of John. Whither our judgment, unassisted by tradition,

called <em>Mount</em> Calvary in the Scriptures. Tradition. Conclusion
to which all this leads us. Circumstances and scene of the crucifixion.
The question with regard to the spot of Our Saviour’s burial.</p>

<p>There are a few places in and about Jerusalem,
in respect to which there can be no possible mistake.
These are, the Mount of Olives; the Valley of Kedron,
sometimes called the valley of Jehoshaphat; the brook
Kedron; the Valley of Hinnom; Mount Moriah;
Mount Zion; and the hill called Bezetha. The
Mount of Olives speaks at once for itself, and has
never been doubted by any one: it descends by a
rapid slope down to the brook Kedron, in summer a
dry water-course about nine feet wide, and in the wet
season an irregular torrent: with regard to this brook,
also, no one has ever had any doubt. This valley
of Kedron formed the eastern boundary of the ancient,<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
as it does now also of the modern city. Immediately
after crossing the brook Kedron towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the west, the ground at present commences ascending
so rapidly, as to require a zigzag path: at the
height of about eighty feet we come to the wall,
and to the general level of the present city. This
slope is made up of debris, or loose stuff, composed of
earth mixed with pottery, fragments of bricks, &amp;c.;
and it seems probable that the ancient wall of Bezetha,
standing on the line of the present rampart,
had without it a much more precipitous descent.</p>

<p>Mount Moriah is at present a piece of level ground,
of the same elevation as those portions of the city
immediately adjoining it on the north and west, and
is not in any way to be distinguished from them.
It is occupied by an open court, about 1500 feet
long and 1000 feet in width, surrounded by a wall
and planted with trees. In the centre is a large oblong
platform, paved, I believe, with marble, and
reached by two or three steps running all around;
on this platform stands the mosque of Omar, which
is said by the Turks to occupy the exact site of the
Temple of Solomon, and is considered by them to be
next in sanctity to the venerated Caaba, or holy
house at Mecca. So sacred is this place in their
eyes, that no Christian is allowed to place his foot
within even the large enclosure. There is thus no
mountain at present here, and if any one should
question whether this was the situation of Mount
Moriah, I answer that it is the only place where we
can look for it. Mount Moriah was on the eastern
side of the city, and adjoining the valley of Kedron;<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the valley of the Cheesemongers, which still
remains, formed its boundary on the south;<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and as
the court of the temple, occupying the whole enlarged
mountain, was 729 feet<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> on each side, we thus
get both the northern and the western boundaries,
and thus have the exact position and limits of Mount
Moriah. It is probable that the Turks are quite correct
in saying that their mosque occupies the site of
the ancient temple, except that the latter was at a
much greater elevation; Mount Moriah having, by
artificial means, been raised to a height of about 700
feet. This mountain was at first a rocky precipice,
irregular both in shape and surface; it was inclosed
by Solomon with a square wall of the dimensions
just described, beginning at the bottom of the valleys
that bounded it on three sides, and rising on the east
and south to the stupendous elevation of 729<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> feet;
on the west, from the nature of the ground below,
its elevation was nearly 200 feet less; the interval
within this was filled with earth, or formed
into extensive suites of vaults; and the surface being
brought nearly to a level, formed an area for the
temple and its various courts.<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> At the north-western<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
angle of the temple was a tower or castle, commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
by the kings of the Asmonean race, but enlarged
and strengthened by Herod, who gave it the name
of Antonia, in honor of Mark Antony, his friend and
patron. It was built on a lofty precipice 1450 feet
in circuit, and consisted of a heavy castle in the
centre, with a tower at each angle, that on the south-east
being of sufficient height to overlook the courts
of the temple.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The opening or outlet of the valley of Tyropœon,
or the Cheesemongers, still remains, and is very distinct.
The ground begins to decline into it as soon
as we leave the court of the mosque of Omar, advancing
southward; and at the distance of about
400 feet we come to its lowest part, and the spot
where it is lost in the valley of Kedron. This opening
is opposite a mountain, called now the Mount of
Offence, but styled by Josephus “that other hill,”
and described by him as just south of the Mount of
Olives. A short distance up this valley we come to
an oblong pool sunk partly in the ground, and walled
on three sides, the fourth being broken down; it
is called the Pool of Siloam, and very probably occupies
the site of the ancient pool of that name
noticed in the Scriptures. A few hundred feet above
this pool the valley enters the modern city, and I
believe cannot be traced any further. There can be
no doubt that it is the ancient Tyropœon, and we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
thus get a portion of the northern boundary of Mount
<em>Zion</em>.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Mount Zion had on the east the valley of Kedron,
and on the south and west the valley of Hinnom,<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or
Gehenna, and these boundaries are now just as described
by Josephus, except that the sides of the valleys
towards the city are now rendered sloping by
the vast quantities of debris or loose stuff from the
ancient city, instead of being perpendicular as they
were in ancient times. That of Hinnom, on its
southern and western sides, still presents that appearance,
a bold perpendicular precipice, which it would
be impossible to scale. This valley is described by
Strabo (lib. xvi.) as having a depth of 60 feet and a
width of 250, which are pretty nearly its present dimensions.
The wall of the ancient city was built on
the edge of the precipice, and, according to Tacitus,
was, in the parts thus guarded by nature, 60 feet in
height; on the northern side of Jerusalem, where the
ground offered fewer advantages, it had the prodigious
elevation of 120 feet.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It was built in a crooked or
zigzag line, “so that they might flank the besiegers
and cast darts on them sideways.”<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>We have thus far had what sailors call plain sailing,
for no one can easily be at a loss as regards the
eastern, southern, and a portion of the western boundaries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of the ancient Jerusalem. The northern
limits offer a subject of greater difficulty, and it is
one also of greater importance, for on this depends
the question whether the spot pointed out as Mount
Calvary be really the place of the crucifixion or not.
The objectors, including almost all Protestant visitors,
say it is not and cannot be, since this spot was
evidently within the ancient city; and both from
the Scriptures, and from the well-known custom of
the Jews on such occasions, we know that this
event occurred without the walls. This subject we
will now examine.</p>

<p>The valley of Cheesemongers, commencing, as we
have seen, just south of the temple, took a course to
the north-westward, and formed the boundary of
Mount Zion on the north, separating this hill from
another on the eastward, called Acra,<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> probably from
the Greek word <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αχρος</i>, <em>high</em>. Acra was originally a
flat<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> on the summit, except at one part, where it rose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to a peak of sufficient height to overlook the temple.
On this Antiochus Epiphanes (B. C. 168.) erected a
citadel, strengthened with high walls and towers,
which proved such serious annoyance to the citizens,
that, under the rule of Simon Maccabeus, (B. C.
143.) not only was the citadel demolished, but, to
prevent its being rebuilt, the hill or peak itself was
cut down to the level of the adjoining ground. In
this way the whole of Acra got to be comparatively
low ground,<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and, to facilitate intercourse between
the Temple and the “Upper City,” or Mount Zion,
a bridge<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> was carried from a gate near the S. W.
corner of the Temple quite across to the neighborhood
of the palace of David.</p>

<p>Of the valley of the Cheesemongers after it enters
the modern city, there are at present no traces, it
having doubtless been filled up at the time when
Jerusalem was levelled with the ground by order of
Titus; but as Mount Zion was much higher than
Acra, we may expect to find some remains of the
steep ascent by which they passed from this valley up to
Zion, or, as it was called by them, “The Upper City.”
And of this there are considerable remains. Mr. Nicholayson’s
house stands about three hundred feet a little
east of south from the Jaffa gate, which is designated
on this <a href="#Jerusalem_map">map</a> by the figure 1, at the place where the
roads from Bethlehem and Jaffa meet. Sixty feet
eastward from his house is a slope, about twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
feet high, and so steep as to make it difficult even
for donkeys to ascend. Standing on its edge, we are
still able to overlook a large part of the city to the
east of it. This slope continues thence to the south-eastward,
keeping parallel to some extensive ruins
now to be seen there, the remains of a hospital belonging
to the time of the Crusades; the slope being
separated from them by a narrow bazaar. This
slope is undoubtedly the north-eastern edge of
Mount Zion, and I have so expressed it in the <a href="#Jerusalem_map">map</a>
which we are endeavoring to form. I have not been
able to trace it further than to the end of this bazaar;
but as it passes in the direction of Siloam, or the
opening of the valley of Cheesemongers, I have
marked it in the map as continuing down to that
place, as I have no doubt that it does. This gives
us the northern boundary of Mount Zion exactly
as described by Josephus, who says that “this city
laid over against the temple in the manner of a theatre.”<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
At the place where this slope approaches the
nearest to the valley of Hinnom, or near Mr. Nicholayson’s,
I have placed the tower of Hippicus, which
stood at the northern angle of the city of Zion.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The “old wall,” as it is called by Josephus, first
erected by David and Solomon, and strengthened by
succeeding kings, commences at the tower of Hippicus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and had its course on the west and south,
directly along the edge of the valley of Hinnom. On
reaching the valley of Kedron, it bent to the northward,
and curving again to the east just below the
pool of Siloam, joined the temple wall nearly at its
south-eastern angle. On the northern side, starting
again at the tower of Hippicus, it kept along the
edge of the bank above the valley of Cheesemongers,
until curving opposite the Xistus, it here crossed
the valley, and passing by the Xistus and the council-house,
joined soon after the western wall of the
temple, probably at the south-western angle.<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>He does not tell us what is meant by “the
Xistus,” but it is probably from the Greek word
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χιστος</i>, “a division” or “separation;” and I suppose
refers to the branching of the valley of the
Cheesemongers, one part keeping along by Mount Zion,
and the other just on the west of Mount Moriah;
the latter branch, as I have already said, was filled
up by the Maccabees. Just south of the temple, on
the ground sloping down to the pool of Siloam, was
a small section of the city called Ophlas.<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that a wall separated also Mount
Zion from Ophlas; for we find, that when Titus had
possession of Acra and the Temple, he had still to
bring his engines against the northern wall of Zion;<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which would not have been necessary if he could
have passed at once through Ophlas into that city.</p>

<p>Mount Zion was called by David “The Citadel;”
it afterwards frequently went by the name of “The
Upper City,” in contradistinction to Acra, the latter
being frequently styled “The Lower City.”<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Acra, we are informed by Josephus, was “in the
shape of a moon when she is horned;”<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and though
he gives no intimation to that effect, I suppose the
horns must have been to the northward, for I do not
see how it is possible that they could have been
otherwise. On the west they certainly could not
have been, nor on the south, nor on the east; and
there remains only the position which I have given
them. The northern wall of Acra, sometimes called
“the second wall,” commenced at the gate Gennath,
(i. e. “gate of the gardens,”) and then making a
curve,<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> terminated at the castle of Antonia.<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> I
have placed the gate Gennath about five hundred
feet from the tower Hippicus, and have carried the
wall, in the first place at right angles across the
valley of the Cheesemongers, and then placing a
tower at the angle, have there commenced the course
over towards Antonia. My reasons for this arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
are as follows. When Titus had set down
with his army before Jerusalem, and came to select
a spot for his assaults, he determined to commence
at the tomb of John the High Priest, because the
outer wall (marked here by the zigzag lines) was
weakest at that place; and here, too, he could pass
at once to the “old” or “third wall,” without the
necessity of first taking the second;<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> which expectation
“of an easy passage to the third wall” would
not have been reasonable, had the gate Gennath and
the branching of the northern wall of Acra been
nearer to the tower of Hippicus than I have placed
them. And when the Romans had taken this outer
wall, and the Jews were driven to their next line of
defences, they immediately commenced a line of
fortification, which seems to have been from the
second wall to the tower of Hippicus; for which
reason, as well as because it is a more rational way
of carrying a wall across a valley, I have made this
angle in the outer wall of Acra.</p>

<p><em>These walls, namely, those of Mount Zion and
Acra, are all that were standing in the time of our
Saviour.</em> The outer wall, marked here by the zigzag
lines, was erected by Agrippa, not till eight
years or more after the crucifixion; a circumstance
that seems to have escaped the attention of those who
maintain that the spot now marked as Calvary was
then within the city. At the time of our Saviour, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
very large suburb extended northward from the
temple and the tower of Antonia, occupying a hill
called Bezetha, but <em>it was not yet walled in</em>. Speaking
of this outer wall, Josephus says, “It was Agrippa
(Agrippa ruled over Judea from A. D. 41 to 43.)
who encompassed the parts added to the old city
with this wall, which had been all naked before; for
as the city grew more populous, it gradually crept
beyond its old limits; and those parts of it that stood
northward of the temple, and joined that hill to the
city, made it considerably larger, and occasioned that
hill, which is in number the fourth, and is called
Bezetha, to be inhabited. It lies over against the
tower Antonia, but is divided from it by a deep valley,
which was dug on purpose.... This new built
part of the city was called <em>Bezetha</em>, in our language,
which, if interpreted in the Grecian language, may
be called <em>The New City</em>. Since, therefore, its inhabitants
stood in need of a covering, the father of
the present king, and of the same name with him,
Agrippa, began that wall we spoke of; but he left
off building it when he had only laid the foundations,
out of the fear he was in of Claudius Cæsar,
lest he should suspect that so strong a wall was
built in order to make some innovation in public
affairs; for the city could no way have been taken if
that wall had been finished in the manner it had
been begun; as its parts were connected together by
stones twenty cubits (thirty-six feet) long and ten
cubits broad, which could never have been either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
easily undermined by any iron tools, or shaken by
any engines. The wall was, however, ten cubits
wide, and it would probably have had a height greater
than that, had not his zeal who began it been hindered
from exerting itself. After this it was erected
with great diligence by the Jews as high as twenty
cubits, above which it had battlements of two cubits,
and turrets of three cubits altitude; insomuch that
the entire altitude extended as far as twenty-five
cubits.”<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> De Bel. lib. v. cap. 4. § 2.</p>

<p>The slope which I have noticed as near Mr.
Nicholayson’s house, and as showing, southward
from that, the outline of Mount Zion, does not however
terminate at the site of the tower Hippicus. It there
bends to the eastward, and again, near the present Latin
convent, turns to the northward, but is at that place
reduced to an elevation of only five or six feet. For
a reason to be seen in Josephus, de Bel. lib. v. c. 7. § 3,
as well as on account of the ground, I have made
Agrippa’s wall, which started from the tower Hippicus,<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
keep along the upper edge of this slope, and
have placed the tomb of John at the angle; the reasons
for which may be found also in the above reference.
Thence the course of this wall is uncertain; we only
know that it proceeded far to the northward, and enclosed
the suburb of Bezetha; but, though the course
which I have drawn corresponds, as far as I can
judge, with the data given us in Josephus, those data
are too few to furnish us with any thing positive. I
think, however, the outline cannot be far from the
truth.</p>

<p>But, as I have just remarked, this wall was not
existing at the time of our Saviour’s crucifixion. If
I am correct in the conclusions which have just
been laid before the reader, the castellated walls on
the map, together with the temple, were the only
portions then enclosed. This would make a small
city; but the extensive suburbs around would make
up for the deficiency of room. Vienna is an example
in our own times, similar to this, where “the
city” or fortified portion is of very limited extent
compared with the vast stretch of suburb attached to
it; these castellated parts of this map have, indeed,
just about the extent of the <em>Burg</em>, or city proper
of Vienna.</p>

<p>The suburb of Bezetha at that time, though
stretching a considerable distance to the north, seems
not to have extended much to the west of Antonia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
for, in addition to the intimation to that effect in
Jos. de Bel. lib. v. cap. 4. § 2, we are informed
that the wall of Agrippa, when erected afterwards,
was left weaker at its south-western extremity than
in the other portions, “the builders neglecting to
build the wall strong where the new city was not
inhabited.”<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The dense portions of this appendage
to Jerusalem were on the higher ground lying directly
northward from the temple, the ground over
towards the spot which I have marked as Calvary
having a few scattered dwellings, and those of the
meanest order. The ground west of this suburb was
probably taken up with great roads, and such
thoroughfares as are usually to be seen in the neighborhood
of a populous city.</p>

<p>And now, if we had no tradition whatever as regards
the spot of our Saviour’s suffering, and were left
simply to the guidance of our own judgment, I think
I should look for it somewhere in this angle between
Hippicus and Bezetha. Public places are usually
selected for such occurrences, and in this instance
the enemies of the sufferer would be apt to seek for
every circumstance that would add to his humiliation.
We are told by the Scriptures (John xix. 20.)
that the place was <em>near</em> the city; and as it is not probable
that they would select a spot on the other side
of the valley of Hinnom or of Kedron, and the hill
Bezetha was covered with houses, we have left
only this angle immediately north of Acra; and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Matthew xxvii. 39, we are informed that “they that
<em>passed by</em> reviled him,” which seems to intimate that
the cross was adjoining some public roads or
thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Our search then is restricted to a narrow compass;
and now, if upon this ground we should find a rocky
knoll about twenty feet or more in height, it would
appear to us that this would be, in all probability,
the spot selected for such an occasion. It would
elevate the sufferers to a height sufficient to expose
them to the eyes of all the multitude, and would in
all respects be adapted to a spectacle like this. Just
such a rock is existing at this day, and <em>is the one
built into the present church of the Crucifixion</em>.
The place is in Scripture no where called <em>Mount</em>
Calvary; but simply Calvary, or “Golgotha, that is,
a place of a skull,” and we have no reason given us
there to look for a larger eminence. Indeed this
seems just such an one as would be selected for such
a purpose, and corresponds, both in elevation and extent,
to its ignominious title.</p>

<p>In these remarks it will be observed, I have been
guided entirely by the judgment, and have endeavored
to see whither it would lead us, without any
reference to traditions on this subject. As we have
seen, it conducts us exactly to the spot that tradition
<em>has always pointed out as the place of the crucifixion</em>.
This tradition I will now proceed also to
notice.</p>

<p>It is not probable that the early Christians would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
soon forget a spot of such tender and deep interest to
them; for, as I observed at the beginning of this
chapter, the subject is also one of some practical
character. It was rather to be feared that they would
attach to it a reverence that would degenerate into
superstition, than that they would entirely forget it.
If at our day the idea of the bare possibility of visiting
Mount Calvary sends a thrill through the whole
system, with what feelings must they have regarded
the place when the memory of this event was fresh
among the Christians, and when they were able to
converse with those who had themselves witnessed
the ignominious death of their Lord and Saviour.
It does not appear to me at all probable that such a
place would be forgotten; and we have a proof of
the respect in which it was held, in the fact that
Hadrian erected on the sepulchre a statue to Jupiter,
and one to Venus on Mount Calvary. This could
have been done only to mock their feelings and distress
them, by desecrating places held by them in
high regard. The fact that he placed these statues
on these spots, at all events shows that they were at
this time (about one hundred years after the events
themselves) considered as the places of the crucifixion
and the sepulture of Christ. Helena, the
mother of Constantine, two hundred years subsequently
to this, erected on the spot a Christian
church, which, with some changes not affecting the
locality, has continued ever since. There is, therefore,
a chain of evidence with regard to these localities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of a very satisfactory kind; and as the judgment
finds no difficulty in the case, but, independently of
tradition, is led to the same conclusion, my own convictions
are clearly and decidedly in their favor.</p>

<p>Let us then examine into the circumstances of this
affecting event. The place of the crucifixion was
about six hundred feet from the city wall, to which
the ground from this place had a gentle descent; on
the east were the low and straggling outskirts of the
large suburb of Bezetha; on the west, the ground, at
the distance of a few hundred feet, sloped upward
rapidly for a short space, and then stretched off in a
long ascending plain; on the northward it also ascends
gently for the distance of more than a mile.
The rock of Golgotha or Calvary is now about sixteen
feet in height, though as the ground around it has
been elevated by the ruins of the old city, it was
probably at that time a few feet higher. It was of
sufficient altitude to bring the sufferer into distinct
view before all the crowds that probably at this time
covered the walls and houses and the upward slopes
of the hills, and to make him visible to those “afar
off.”<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> A few gardens were near; but most of the
space around this rocky knoll was open, and traversed
by the dusty thoroughfares to the populous city.</p>

<p>It was now the Passover, and more than two millions
of people had come up to Jerusalem;<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the city,
the suburbs, were crowded, the country around was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
covered with the dense multitude; and the ceaseless
hum of men, even in their calmer moments, was like
the deep hollow roar of the ocean.&mdash;And now the
multitudes are agitated, and the stormy passions
are at work amid the countless throng.&mdash;He who
had excited the wonder of the Jewish nation, and the
rage of the priests and of the stately Pharisees, had
been brought forward before the judgment-seat of the
high-priest and the governor of Judea, and had been
condemned for blasphemy.&mdash;He, for blasphemy! The
good, the benevolent, the Godlike! who had given
sight to the blind, and had caused the lame to walk,
and had healed the sick, and had brought the dead
to life; who had led their thoughts to heaven, and
taught them pure and holy doctrines; and had been
among them in his miracles with the power of the
Divinity himself. He, for blasphemy? Yes, he had
publicly, before their council, declared himself to be
the Christ, the Son of God, and that they should see
him sitting on the right hand of power, and coming
from heaven in majesty; and he had foretold that of
their glorious temple, the object almost of their idolatry,
not one stone should be left upon another; and
had been accused of saying that he himself would
destroy it. The passions of the dense multitudes rise;
and rumor, with her exaggerations, excites them to
phrensy.&mdash;And now comes forth the sufferer, bearing
his cross; his back lacerated with thongs, his brow
dropping blood from the crown placed on it in
mockery. Though sinking under fatigue and pain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
he meets no commiseration but is driven on with
tauntings and scorn; and they come to the place of
public execution, and the victim is nailed to the
cross, and between two malefactors is raised up to
be a spectacle to man; and wherever he turns his
agonized eyes he sees only rage and scorn; and his
ears hear only bitter tauntings;&mdash;“he saved others;
himself he cannot save.” “If he be the king of Israel
let him come down now from the cross, and we will
believe him.” “He trusted in God; let him deliver
him now if he will have him; for he said, I am the
Son of God.”</p>

<p>There is a punishment somewhat similar to this
of crucifixion, that until lately was practised in Algiers
and in various parts of Turkey. The criminal
was thrown from the top of a wall and caught by
large hooks projecting from its side, and there left
to perish. His torments were frightful. A fever
seized on the body, and excruciating pains coursed
through the whole system; the eyes became bloodshot
and glaring, and starting from their sockets; the
sufferer was burnt up by a scorching thirst, and
begged piteously for drink, and after many hours
died in frightful agonies.</p>

<p>Death upon the cross was probably similar to this,
for the nails were driven through the hands and feet,
where are congregated an unusual number of delicate
nerves; and by them the whole weight of the
body was suspended. The agonies were probably
even greater than those I have been describing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the price of our redemption. “He hath
borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; he was
bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our
peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are
healed.”</p>

<p>The question with regard to the place of our Saviour’s
burial is in a measure dependent on that into
which we have just been examining, and will therefore
not require more than a few minutes’ attention.
St. John (xix. 41, 42.) tells us that “<em>in the place</em>
where he was crucified, there was a garden; and in
the garden a new sepulchre, wherein never man was
yet laid. There laid they Jesus, therefore, because
of the Jews’ preparation day, for the sepulchre was
<em>nigh at hand</em>.” We are therefore to look for this
spot close in the neighborhood of Calvary; and I
think that the merriment in which Protestant visitors
sometimes have indulged on finding the spot pointed
out for the sepulchre, so near that of the crucifixion,
to be quite out of place. It certainly is in bad taste;
for whatever these places may be, they bear sad
and solemn names, and have been regarded by
Christians from time immemorial as really the places
of our Saviour’s bloody death and burial, and glorious
resurrection. However, then, we may be disposed
to regard their genuineness, we should approach
them with solemn feelings; and levity or
sarcasm in such a place becomes us very ill.</p>

<p>For myself, I believe that as regards the place of
our Saviour’s crucifixion, there is no just ground for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
disbelief, nor can I see much as regards also that
pointed out as the place for burial. It is about 110
feet from the rocky knoll, and is not at all too near
to have a garden wall intervene, and make this a
proper place for Joseph of Arimathea to hew out a
sepulchre. <em>Gennath</em>, the name of the gate opening
from the Upper City to this place, means gardens,<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and it is probable that much of this space was originally
occupied with gardens. We find also that it
was a place of tombs; for the monument of the high-priest
John was near this, as were also probably
“the monuments of king Alexander.”<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The circumstances
of the case are, therefore, in favor of this
spot; the Scriptures in some measure give it their
sanction, and tradition from the earliest years has
been uniform on the subject. Hadrian over it erected
the statue of Jupiter, and here also Helena built a
church; and among the rival sects of the Greek
and Latin church, which soon after sprung up, and
which have been endeavoring to appropriate, each
to itself, as much as possible of the holy places, no
one has ever attempted to designate another spot.</p>

<p>I confess I take pleasure in believing that the spot
pointed out to us as that of our Saviour’s sepulture,
is the true one; and that, to the scene of his deep humiliation
and his agony for us is in close proximity
the scene of his triumph over hell and the grave;
and though it can be no argument, I confess there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
seems to me to be a fitness of things where we are
allowed to stand where stood the cross of Christ, and
look down on the empty tomb, and say through
him, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where
is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the
strength of sin is the law; but thanks be to God
which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
Christ.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Commencement of our visits. Hospital of the knights of St. John.
Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Reputed tomb of the Saviour.
Marble sarcophagus. Effect of this visit on us. Question whether
this is the real tomb, or only a representation of it. Removal
of the floor two centuries since. Greek chapel “the centre
of the world.” Origin of the various incredible traditions.
Charity to be exercised. Cave where the cross is said to have
been discovered. Fissure in the rock. Tradition about the head
of Adam. Calvary. Holes for the crosses. Another fissure in
the rock. The humiliation in the tomb, and resurrection.</p>

<p>We were glad, on arriving at Mr. Nicholayson’s,
to find the ladies of the Commodore’s family
quite recovered from the effects of the preceding
day’s severe fatigue. Mrs. Nicholayson herself
was in a feeble state of health, occasioned by her
watchings over Mrs. Thompson’s couch, and exposures
during the earthquake, and the subsequent
fighting in the city; their house, as has already been
observed, having been used as an advanced point of
attack on the citadel. The presence of ladies speaking
her own language had immediately an astonishing
effect on her spirits, and she became rapidly
convalescent.</p>

<p>Impatient, and with feelings almost in a nervous
state, we soon found ourselves out, and winding along
the narrow lane that leads from Mr. Nicholayson’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to the slope by which we descend from Mount Zion
to the lower city. Standing on the edge of this, we
looked down on the ruins of a great edifice erected
for the knights of St. John at the time of the
Crusades. It is a very large building, I should
think near six hundred feet in length by two hundred
in width; but the lower story or basement is
all that now remains. This forms a suite of vaults,
which are now occupied as stores for grain and
merchandize; a street of shops forming a kind of
bazaar passes along the western side of it, and on
the south is the principal bazaar of the city, the exterior
range of vaults answering very well for stores.
The place where we were then standing was about
the spot where I suppose the gate Gennath to have
been.</p>

<p>Descending from this eminence, we entered a
street which passes along the northern side of this
ruin, and is lined with fruit shops and houses, sometimes
one, sometimes two stories in height, of stone,
the windows small and the exterior very plain.
This street is about one thousand feet in length. At
its further extremity on our right was an edifice distinguished
by its size and massiveness, but presenting
on the exterior only a bare wall pierced with a
few narrow windows. This was “The Church of
the Holy Sepulchre.” It forms altogether a block
of masonry about one hundred and sixty feet by one
hundred in width, in which are included the chapel
of the Crucifixion, the church of the Sepulchre, some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
small chapels, and a monastery, the cloisters of the
monks occupying the portions of the building next
the street. Just before coming to this building, we
entered a low door in a stone wall, and then, having
descended along a narrow alley, we turned presently
to the left, and had before us the court and
grand entrance to the church. On our left was the
church tower, but without bells, as, with the single
exception of Mount Lebanon, bells are not allowed
to Christian churches in Turkey. The height of this
tower has also been reduced, from a similar feeling
of jealousy on the part of their Turkish masters.
Three sides of the court were formed by a mass of
buildings of irregular shape, while the fourth, or
that looking towards the west, was open; in the
central part was an arched portal ornamented with
columns of verd-antique, and sculptures of the
Norman style of architecture; it was open at the
time of our visit, and I believe is so daily for an hour
or two in the morning. After this it is closed, the
key is returned to the Turkish governor; and admittance
during the rest of the day, if desired, must be
purchased from him. The monks, therefore, are
prisoners in their monastery, except during this
short interval, and intercourse with them must be
held through a square hole in this door, where also
provisions and other necessaries are taken in. We
visited the place once in the afternoon, and were
allowed to enter after waiting nearly an hour, and
at the cost of a dollar or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing through this door, the visiter finds himself
in a hall or vestibule, about forty feet long by
twenty in width; and in front of him, on the floor,
a slab of reddish marble, with huge candlesticks and
candles at either end; they call it the stone of
unction, and say that on it our Saviour’s body was
anointed previous to interment. And here commences
a series of legends and fictions, dealt out
unsparingly to the visitor, which often produce disgust,
and always jar on the feelings of the pilgrim
whose mind is not steeped in the grossest credulity.
I could fill a book with them, but have no
relish for such a task; and during this visit gave
but little attention to them, as I wished to keep my
feelings free from the effect of such puerilities; and
I shall at present trouble the reader with them
only so far as to give him an idea of this blot on
Christianity at Jerusalem. By doing more, we
should only stir up emotions that cannot harmonize
with the place, and which will prevent us from
feeling the influence of that which is real and true.</p>

<p>Turning now to the left we came, at the distance
of about twenty feet, to a large door-way which
admitted us into a circular church, quite lofty, and
about fifty feet in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The lower part of this is lined with a range of
pilasters, between which are arched openings into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
dozen chapels, some used by the Copts, Greeks, and
Armenians, and some occupied by altars connected
with the legends which have just been noticed.
Above these runs a corridor, and the whole is surmounted
by the large dome which had drawn my
attention when on the top of our monastery. In the
centre of the area of this church is a structure of
masonry, about eight feet wide, eight or nine in
height, and about twelve in length; at one end is a
marble platform, raised about twelve inches from the
floor, with steps quite around, and bordered part of
the length with a low marble wall or parapet on
either side; the other end of this structure, instead
of being square, has three faces, in which are very
small chapels for the Copts, Abyssinians, &amp;c. The
structure itself is faced with the richest marbles, in
compartments, and enriched with mouldings, and
has on the summit a little tower like a lantern, used,
I believe, as a vent for the smoke from some lamps
within the tomb. Yes, this, they tell us, is the
tomb of our Saviour, hewn originally in the solid
rock; but that the exterior rock has been cut
down so as to form a kind of shell, in the shape
of a chapel, with its exterior surface enriched
in this manner with marble. If this be so, they have
sadly disguised the place, for, being lined with marble
also in the interior, it has now not the least
resemblance to what the Scripture account of it
would lead us to expect. The entrance is at the
end towards the east. We ascended the marble
platform, and entering by a low door found ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in a chamber about six feet wide and five in
depth, in the centre of which is an upright column
irregularly shaped, about two feet in height. They
say it is the stone on which the angel sat when he
announced the resurrection to Mary Magdalene, and
Mary the mother of James, and Salome. At the
further end of this room, at the corner on the left,
is a low door; and there, stooping down, we
entered another chamber about six feet square.
One half of this latter apartment was occupied by
a marble sarcophagus; and in this, they say, was
deposited the body of our crucified Saviour.</p>

<p>For a while we were unwilling, and I believe
should have been unable, to enter into the inquiry
whether this was really so;&mdash;so strong an emotion
was created by the annunciation that we were in
our Lord’s sepulchre, and that before us was the
coffin where his body had lain, and from which he
rose triumphant, leading captivity captive. We stood
for a long time silent, gazing on the marble; and I
believe it would have taken little to have caused us
to shed tears. The place was lighted only by lamps
suspended from the ceiling over the coffin; no
sounds were heard, except occasionally of our deep
breathing, as our emotions became almost too strong
to be restrained. And our feelings, I believe, were of
a salutary nature.</p>

<p>There was then in our company, one of whom I
am allowed here to speak, but whom the shrinking
modesty which she always evinced while living, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
which should still be regarded, will allow me barely
to notice. She was dear to us all; and although,
with such solemn scenes as these around us, it becomes
me to speak with humility of worldly accomplishments,
I may say she possessed them in an
unusual degree, and that she was admired and beloved
at home and abroad by every one that knew
her. She is now no longer in this world. In the
grave, earthly accomplishments, and even earthly
love, avail us nothing; but religion does avail; and
the religion of the cross of Christ, so full of hope and
glory, she was led to adopt by this visit to Calvary
and to the sepulchre of Christ. She had been educated
by pious friends, and had respected and esteemed the
ordinances of the gospel; but this visit, and the
scenes here brought before her mind, made her
realize as she had not done before, how great was
the price paid for her salvation, and how strong are
our obligations to give ourselves unhesitatingly to
Him who hesitated not to give himself for us. Selecting
a proper time, when the act would be free from
ostentation, she took out her Bible, which she had
brought to the city, and placing it on the coffin, wrote,
as was long after discovered, her name and the date
of our visit, with the quotation, “Let every thing
that hath breath praise the Lord.” Not long after
her return to the ship she made a meek yet decided
avowal of this Saviour as her only hope and trust;
and all who knew her witnessed a corresponding
exhibition of Christian character. For the change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
which brought the humble and gentle virtues into
striking relief, while hope rose higher and became
full of immortality, she always referred to this visit
as the immediate cause. She was, at that time, apparently
in excellent health; but youth and health
are no guarantee for us in this our earthly home.
When our ship, eighteen months afterwards, approached
our own shore, it bore her a feeble and
exhausted invalid; and when land at length rose to
our sight, we scarcely heeded it; for she, our companion
so long, and so beloved by us, was now a
corpse. She had expired suddenly only the evening
previous. By her mourning parents in that hour of
anguish, I heard this visit spoken of, and they found
in its consequences a source of consolation, such as
the whole earth could not have afforded them; to
her, had she possessed worlds, what would they have
been in comparison with her religion?</p>

<p>When we spoke, at length, as we stood by the
coffin in this sepulchre, it was involuntarily in low
tones, and in brief sentences; and it was a relief to
get out where the feelings were less oppressive. I
speak of the sensations of others as well as of my
own; for I have since frequently heard them speak
of this visit and of its effects on their feelings.</p>

<p>Our feelings however, in this case, led captive by
the scene around us, by the silent chamber lighted by
a few lamps, the marble coffin, and the tradition that
this was our Lord’s sepulchre, acted without the concurrence
of our judgment; or rather, they suspended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
for a while the power of judging or the disposition
to inquire. Yet, although for reasons already given,
I have little doubt that this was the spot of our Saviour’s
interment, the assertion that this is the sepulchre
itself, wants confirmation; and the marble coffin
or sarcophagus, I cannot regard as any thing more
than a mere <em>representation</em> of the grave, or the place
where the body was deposited; and for this it is by
no means happily chosen. This <em>may</em> be the
sepulchre, cut on the outside into the form of a little
chapel; but as nothing but marble is seen both within
and on the outside, the native rock, if it exists, being
no where allowed to appear, we have no means of
satisfying ourselves that it is so; and the circumstances
are altogether suspicious, particularly when
taken in connexion with the many other assertions
with regard to sacred places in Jerusalem which are
manifestly beyond belief. The coffin is of white
marble, slightly marked by a few veins of a light blue
color; it is rectangular, six feet long within, about
three feet broad, and two feet two inches in depth;
being in all respects exactly like the ancient sarcophagi
found all over Greece and in Asia; the cover
remains, and the whole exterior has a slight degree
of roughness, as if it might once have been exposed
to the weather. This is entirely at variance with
the ancient tombs still to be seen in great numbers
about Jerusalem, and particularly in the district
lying north from the present city. They are composed
sometimes of a single chamber, sometimes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a succession of chambers, cut in the solid rock, with
a rectangular cavity large enough for a body, in
the floor, at the side of the chamber; in the larger
chambers, there are more than one cavity, and in a
few cases, instead of being cut in the floor, they
form a box against the side, but cut also out of the
solid rock. In no case that I have heard of, has a
marble sarcophagus been found within them, none
would be needed; and even in the tombs of the kings
of some magnificence, northward from the city, the
native rock has been exclusively employed. The
evidence is altogether against this marble sarcophagus,
and I cannot yield it my belief.</p>

<p>But still, whether it was that I had some lingering
doubts on the subject, or whether it was the name it
bore, and the silent and lamp-lit chamber in which it
is presented, I cannot say: but though I visited this
chamber repeatedly, it was always with a feeling of
awe mingled with a degree of reverence.</p>

<p>There was in the city, at the time of our visit, an
English gentleman, who had become a Roman
Catholic, and was now a priest, but was a man of
enlightened and liberal views; he had been residing
some time at Lisbon, and had now been sent to Jerusalem
with the contribution of the Portuguese
churches for this year. He visited us frequently at
Mr. Nicholayson’s; and we were all struck both with
his intelligence and very gentlemanly manners. He
informed me that a short time previous to this, when
occupied one day in examining the library of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
principal Latin convent, he lighted on an old musty
book, written in Latin by the father guardian of Jerusalem
about three centuries since. The author
said, that during his residence here it was found necessary
to take up the pavement of this church in
order to make some repairs; that he watched the process
with deep attention, and that his satisfaction can
scarcely be imagined, when, on coming to the native
rock, he found, immediately under this spot, a chamber
cut in the rock, and corresponding exactly to
the tombs we find about the city. That on further
research among the old records of the convent, he
(the father guardian) found it stated, that in ancient
times the sepulchre had stood open and exposed; and
was beginning to be greatly mutilated by pilgrims,
each one being desirous of carrying away some portion
of the sacred rock. In order to preserve it, a
strong railing was built around; but that now, the
visitors being debarred from touching the sepulchre,
votive offerings, rags,<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> &amp;c. were thrown in by them
in such quantities that the place soon become offensive;
and that finally, to prevent this new evil, the
tomb was filled up, and a small chapel was erected
over it, with a sarcophagus, as a representative of the
real sepulchre beneath.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>The account of the father guardian has the appearance
of probability, but the reader is left to take
it for what he may consider it worth. I tried to get
sight of the book; but as the convent was in quarantine
on account of the plague, could not succeed;
and I regret to say that I have forgotten its title.</p>

<p>The light which we can gain from the Scriptures
on this subject, joined with the uniform tradition,
lead me to suppose that this is the spot; whatever
may be the fact with regard to the sepulchre itself,
whether it be now beneath the structure going by its
name, or whether it has been cut away to make room
for a heathen temple erected by Hadrian, or for the
present church.</p>

<p>The little chapel of the Sepulchre stands in the
centre of the great church, facing the east. Directly
in front of it is a large opening into a church owned
by the Greeks, and no wise remarkable, except for a
ball suspended from the ceiling, and a plate beneath
it, on which is an inscription, telling that this is the
centre of the world.</p>

<p>The authority for this is in Ps. lxxiv. 12. “For
God is my King of old, working salvation in the
midst of the earth;” and here I must warn the reader
that his feelings will sometimes be shocked in the
course of these visits, and I must be allowed to
warn him also against allowing his disgust to operate
so as to make him reject the truth with the error.
This is not consistent with the principles of sound
judgment, but the contrary. Where truth is, error<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
will generally come; and error, as I have already
remarked, is to a certain degree a proof that there is
truth somewhere; for man could not hang up such a
mass of fictions if there was not something real to
hang it upon; and generally, the more important the
truth, the more earnest is error to draw advantage
therefrom.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, join in the frequent outcry of
imposition, craft and falsehood against the sects who
hold these places, and recite these traditions to the
visitor. That such things as these are to be found
in high and sacred seats, is doubtless true, and that
they are sometimes practised here is also very probable;
but I can find, for a great many of these traditions,
an origin of a more charitable nature, and I
believe one more consonant with the real state of the
case. We live now in an age of light and knowledge,
and find it hard even to imagine the darkness
that once covered Europe and all these lands. We
can form only some idea of it from the books of the
middle ages&mdash;books full of fable and false philosophy
on every subject. These fables on medicine, on
alchemy, on astrology, and on a multitude of other
topics, grew up, we are willing to believe, from men’s
ignorance; in some cases there may have been deliberate
deception; but in most, their origin was in the
gross ignorance of the times; they show the strivings
of minds shorn of their strength by diseases hereditary
and for ages universal; men saw but dimly, and
wandered into the ways of error when really and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
honestly in search of truth. And if we are willing
to extend this charity to the other sciences, why not
also to that of religion, where men’s feelings are apt
to be more warmly affected, and even in a good
cause, to warp the judgment, particularly if it be
weak, than in any other? In this very city, the Mahomedans
have a great variety of traditions with
respect to the mosque of Omar, and some other of
their sacred places about Jerusalem, quite as wild
as any thing among the Christian sects; yet when
we listen to them, we do not at once cry out “craft
and roguery,” and believe the narrator to be wilfully
imposing on us. We are willing to suppose him
honest. We look at him; his face is grave; he has
the appearance of sincerity; and we attribute the
error to the deep and dark ignorance in which these
people are known to live. Now I wish to claim
for the Christian traditions just what we are willing
to give to those of the Mahomedans. The
principle of charity may, it is true, be carried too far,
but I wish to see it carried further than it is. Let
us go among these sacred places cautious, as cautious
as you choose; but not sneering, or cultivating
bitter feelings towards one another; let us pity the
ignorance of our brother and commiserate him, but not
load him with harsh epithets. Uncharitable insinuations
are certainly very much out of place in this region,
which should excite only humble and tender feelings;
where, amid tauntings and contumely showered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
upon him, the Saviour prayed, “Father, forgive
them, <em>for they know not what they do</em>.”</p>

<p>After leaving the Greek chapel, we crossed to the
western side of this circular church; and here entering
a narrow winding passage, came presently to a floor
of naked rock with two graves cut in it, called the
Sepulchres of Joseph of Arimathea and of Nicodemus.
They are just deep enough to contain a
body; that of Nicodemus is only about four and a
half feet in length.</p>

<p>From this place we were taken to a chapel on the
northern side of the church, where, they say, our
Saviour appeared to the Virgin after his resurrection;
and next, by a winding passage, to a place
in the rear of the Greek church, where are
altars marking, it is said, the spots where they cast
lots for his garments; where he was confined till
they had prepared the cross; where occurred the
conversion of Longinus, the officer who pierced his
side with a spear, &amp;c. Here also we were conducted,
by a descent of forty steps, into a large cave, the
place where Helena discovered the cross. They tell
us that the Jews, in order to stop the adoration of
the cross by the early Christians, cast it here into a
hole called the “Valley of Corpses,” where it remained
three hundred years; that Helena, on digging for it,
discovered three crosses, and, unable to distinguish
which was the one she was searching for, had them
carried to the place where is now the chapel of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Virgin, and where was then a woman at the point
of death; and that the sick person being made
to touch them, two produced no effect, but the
third or true cross restored her immediately to
health.</p>

<p>Ascending from the cave and following another
dark passage, we came presently into a chapel about
fifteen feet square, one side of which is formed by a
bare precipitous rock. This is a portion of the rocky
knoll of Golgotha or Calvary; and here they showed
us a rent or fissure about sixteen inches in width,
telling us that it was formed at the time of the crucifixion,
when the veil of the temple was rent in
twain, and with the quaking of the earth the rocks
were rent. They tell also a story, which I feel loth
to repeat, that here, at the time just spoken of, the
head of Adam was discovered; and that when the
Saviour’s side was pierced, the blood and water
flowed down upon it; that, as Adam had been the
first to sin, he might be the first to experience the
benefit of the redemption.</p>

<p>After giving an impatient glance at these various
spots, we passed on; and soon after, emerging once
more into daylight, found ourselves in the vestibule,
and at the foot of the staircase leading to the summit
of Calvary.</p>

<p>I have mentioned, that on entering the vestibule
from the outer court, we had before us the stone of
unction, and on the left the entrance to the circular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Church of the Sepulchre. On the right, at the distance
of about thirty-five feet, is a narrow stairway
of eighteen steps, cut in the solid rock, and leading
to a platform elevated about sixteen feet above the
lower church, and nearly square, having about forty
feet on each side. This is Mount Calvary. The
surface is now level, and paved with red marbles;
and, by a kind of partition formed of two arches
with square columns between, is divided into two
chambers, one being nearly square and the other
oblong. They are surmounted by a dome, more
peaked than that over the church of the Holy
Sepulchre. When we reached the top of the stairway,
we found ourselves in the first of these chambers, or
the square one; but were first taken across it into
the other, where a large star, formed of marble mosaic
work in the pavement, was pointed out as indicating
the spot where the Saviour was nailed to the cross.
That designated as the place where the crosses stood
during the crucifixion is in the first chamber, at its
northern side.</p>

<p>Returning to this place, we found there a platform
against the wall, running the whole way across the
church, and sixteen inches in height by about three
feet in width. It was also covered with marbles,
and half way across had a large embossed silver
plate with a hole in the centre; and this is said to
be over the very spot where stood our Saviour’s
cross. On each side are similar plates, said to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
over the holes for the other two crosses; but the
holes are so near together, that the arms of the three
crosses could not have been in a line, unless, as
might have been the case, that of the Saviour was
higher or lower than the others. I put my hand
several times through the hole in the central silver
plate, and found beneath it a hollow of rough sides,
rather large, and about a foot or fifteen inches in
depth. Half way between it and the hole on our
right, as we stood facing them, is another plate of
silver about thirty inches in length, and with a narrow
slit in it, corresponding, they informed us, to a
fissure in the rock, the commencement of the crevice
which we had seen below. There is something
very much like a crack, about two inches wide, the
opposite parts of which appear to correspond; but a
close examination is prevented by the silver plate
above; its direction is across the natural stratification
of the rock. The object of these silver plates
is probably to guard these places from violence, as
pilgrims or other visitors are much given to chipping
off fragments from such spots<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> for friends at
home. Whether these are really the holes where
the crosses stood, and whether this is a real fracture
or “rent” in the rock, it is impossible to say; there
can be no doubt, however, that this is really a mass
of native rock; and its elevation is just such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
would be desired for the infliction of death by
crucifixion. It is now so built around, and so,
covered with marbles, that it is not easy to form an exact
judgment of its original altitude or extent; but
if I may venture a rough estimate of the former,
I should say it was about twenty or twenty-five
feet. It appears to be nearly precipitous at the
northern end.</p>

<p>Our feelings while standing on Mount Calvary
were of that high-wrought but solemn kind that
we had experienced while at the Sepulchre, but
not perhaps so strong in degree; for although
this was a place of agony and shame, and yet of
the highest moral grandeur, there was connected
with the other a depth of humiliation, a completeness
of abandonment, that was extremely affecting.
The grave had received the body of the
sufferer, cold and stiffened in death; the winding
sheet was around those mangled limbs, and
over the temples where the blood stood on many
a wound. Nature that day had sympathized and
shuddered,&mdash;but this now had passed; the taunters,
after praying that his blood might be on them
and on their children, had gone their way; the
disciples were appalled and had fled; the tomb
was sealed up, and the moon threw its mild rays on
a scene forsaken apparently of God and of man,
except the silent sentry pacing to and fro. The
humiliation was now complete; the price of our
ransom was paid to the utmost, and then glory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
from heaven poured down upon the spot. The
God-Redeemer rose, and death, who, though conqueror,
had set trembling to see the Creator of all
things prostrate and beneath his sway, was now himself
led captive, and made a ministering servant to
bring the redeemed to eternal glory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Dimensions of the Modern City. Ground within the city, and in

visits. Via Dolorosa. Sentence of the Saviour from Salignatius.
House of Veronica and Picture of the Napkin. House of “the

<p>The modern Jerusalem is about three fourths of
a mile at its greatest length, and about two thirds of
a mile in width.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It contains a population of about
20,000 persons; namely, 10,000 Mahomedans occupying
principally the northern and eastern portions;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
6,000 Jews living on what was formerly the Acra;
3,500 Greeks and Catholics, around the church of
Calvary; and about 500 Armenians, in and about
their great convent on Mount Zion. Of the last
eminence only a small portion is included within the
limits of the present city.</p>

<p>Seen from the Mount of Olives, Jerusalem appears
to stand on a plain declining gently towards the east;
but the ground is far from being an unbroken level.
On the contrary, it is quite uneven, though in no
part rising into hills, unless the remains of Mount
Zion be entitled to this name. The steep descent
from Zion on the eastward I have already noticed.
Passing from Calvary to the south-east, we begin immediately
to descend, and towards the site of the ancient
castle of Antonia the slope is very rapid; then succeeds
a piece of low ground for the space of 100 feet;
and next as we reach the site of the castle is an eminence
fifteen or twenty feet in height, with a rapid
ascent from the west, but sloping gradually down
towards the gate of St. Stephen (<a href="#Jerusalem_map">marked <em>c</em></a>) in the
eastern wall. From Calvary, northward and westward,
the ground ascends by a gentle inclination,
with the exception of the rapid slope already mentioned,
at the line which I have marked for Agrippa’s
wall. But this slope does not continue far.</p>

<p>Without the city on the south and west, after
crossing the valley of Hinnom, we find ourselves on
an open and rather barren plain ascending gently as
it recedes from the city, and stretching off for a distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of two or three miles; on the northward the
ground is rolling for a few miles, when it begins to
ascend, and at the distance of about five miles attains
considerable elevation; there was probably the
<em>Scopus</em> of ancient times.</p>

<p>On this, the northern side, Jerusalem as it is approached
appears to the best advantage, as the cultivated
grounds, the olives scattered thickly around, the
verdant slopes of the Mount of Olives, towering upward
just on the left, impress the visitor favorably with the
environs of the city; while the walls of the city
itself, at the northern end battlemented in a fanciful
manner, and by numerous angles broken in a picturesque
form, produce, with their numerous towers,
a very favorable effect. Jerusalem, however, seen
from a great many points of view, is a highly picturesque
city; and I can say for myself at least, that I
found it presenting on the outside a more imposing
appearance than I had anticipated. War and the
earthquake had left the interior wretched indeed;
nor, as far as we could judge, have its narrow streets,
and its low rude houses, even in better times, any
thing very attractive; but from numerous places
without, and particularly as we wound along the
valleys below, its battlements, and castles, and towers,
rising from the edge of the high steep bank, and
brought into strong relief against the sky, sometimes
overhanging our path, and sometimes stretching off
to a distance, appearing and disappearing along the
uneven ground, had a very picturesque effect.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
When viewed from the Mount of Olives, the whole
city appears like a map at our feet. The houses,
which are of stone, are seldom more than two stories
in height, and on the exterior are rude and without
any pretensions to beauty; but when seen from an
elevated spot, the city has a singular appearance, in
consequence of the domes, with which every dwelling
is covered. Sometimes every chamber in the
house has its dome; and as these are whitewashed
on the exterior, when we look down upon it from the
Mount of Olives, the whole city appears dotted over
with these excrescences. A couple of open green
spots just within the walls, a few trees rising here
and there, the tower of the church of the Holy Sepulchre
and its large domes, several minarets, and
close to us the extensive open court of the mosque
of Omar, with its trees, and in the centre the handsome
mosque itself, complete the view as seen from
the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>The walls of Jerusalem are twenty-five or thirty
feet in height, and are flanked with numerous towers,
both circular and square; and at the Jaffa gate are
still further strengthened by a mass of buildings
forming a castle. There are four principal gates;
and on the north and south two smaller ones or
posterns, which, however, I believe are seldom
used.</p>

<p>Leaving the church of the Holy Sepulchre, we
turned down a street at right angles to the one by
which we had come, and leading towards Mount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Moriah. It forms a portion of the “Via Dolorosa,”
or way by which, they tell us, our Saviour came,
bearing his cross, from the judgment hall to the
place of his suffering. The street is narrow and
badly paved, and at the distance of about 600 feet
from the church, is crossed, for a space of twenty feet,
by a low heavy arch, which, they say, is a remnant
of the ancient gateway. I suppose this arch is near
the line of the northern wall of Acra, but, apart from
what is said in Josephus, (de Bel. lib. vii. cap. i. § 1.)
this arch wants the massive character of that wall;
and the account is not at all probable. They call
it the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Puerta Judicaria</i>, and point to a broken
column as one on which the Roman authorities
were accustomed to stick the sentence of persons
condemned to death; and they quote from Salignatius
that of our Saviour as posted here. “<em>Jesus of
Nazareth, a subverter of the kingdom, a derider
of Cæsar, and a false Messiah, as is proved by
the evidence of the chief men of his nation, is to
be led to the place of common punishment, and
with mock majesty is to be crucified between two
thieves; hasten, Lictor, and prepare the crosses.</em>”</p>

<p>We pass on, and again they try to tax our credulity
by pointing to a house on the left, about two
hundred feet below this gate, as the veritable house
of Veronica, a pious woman living at the time of
the crucifixion. They say that as Jesus passed by
this dwelling, his face covered with blood streaming
from the crown of thorns, Veronica offered a napkin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
which, having been pressed against his face, when
given again to her was found to present an exact
copy of his features. Pictures of the Saviour are
to be seen in all Catholic countries, represented
as painted on a towel, and said to be copies from
this.</p>

<p>Though we cannot believe it, yet there is something
pretty in the tradition; and the same may be
said of a great many of the traditions which they
relate to us, but it would require an excess of credulity
to suppose that this is her house, when we
know that by the infuriated soldiers of Titus every
dwelling was destroyed;<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and the appearance of the
building itself must satisfy us that it is comparatively
a modern dwelling.</p>

<p>Still lower down they put a climax to all this by
pointing out the very house in which dwelt “the
rich man,” and the spot (on the opposite side of the
street) where Lazarus used to recline. The house
is a large good looking edifice, and I believe is now
occupied by Aboo Ghoosh.</p>

<p>Here the Via Dolorosa bends, for a short space, to
the left, and then, turning again in the direction of
St. Stephen’s gate, ascends a low eminence, and terminates
at what they call the ruins of Pilate’s house.
At this place is a lofty arch over the street, with two
windows above, in which, they tell us, the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
governors were accustomed to address the people;
and which they call “Ecce Homo,” from a tradition
that the Saviour was there brought out before the
Jews, when they cried out, demanding his crucifixion.
(John xix. 5.) Here, too, they showed us
the place from which were taken a suite of marble
steps, now shown at Rome, as then belonging to the
Judgment Hall, and which I have seen in that city,
where no one is allowed to ascend them except on
his knees. Indeed, all the region around this spot
is fruitful in their traditions; some of which are sufficiently
curious, but the reader has probably by this
time had enough of them. I will only add, that the
windows over the arch had formerly a pillar between
them; but that on one occasion a deputy of the
Sultan being on a visit to the cities of Syria,
on his arrival at Jerusalem the Father Guardian of
the Latins neglected to carry him a present, on
which the deputy ordered him to carry this pillar
on his shoulders to the mosque of Omar. “But for
this he was well chastised; for, on departing from
Jerusalem, he fell from his horse and broke a leg;
so at least it is affirmed by many.”<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Pilate’s house stands a short distance from the
street leading to St. Stephen’s gate; and we turned
aside to it, not to speculate upon their traditions, but
for the advantage offered by the lofty terrace that
forms its roof for getting a good view of the mosque<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of Omar. The Turks will allow no Christian to
enter even the court of this mosque, and as the
edifice from which we had our view forms a part of
its boundary, we were able, from our elevated position,
to overlook the whole of it.</p>

<p>This court stands at the south-eastern angle of the
present city, the walls of which bound it on the east
and partly at the south. Its dimensions are 1500
feet by 1000; and it therefore occupies considerably
more ground than the ancient Mount Moriah, which
was, I suppose, towards its southern extremity. Its
clean grounds, and the shade trees which are scattered
over them, make a very pretty appearance.
The platform in its centre is ornamented along the
edge on either side by a species of triumphal arch;
and the mosque itself, which stands towards the
southern end of this platform, is a very handsome
building. It is octagonal, and is built of light colored
marble with blackish veins, into which are set pannels
of a darker shade. The other portion of the
building, and the lofty cupola, are ornamented with
various colored tiles disposed in fanciful patterns;
and below, at each of the entrances, is an ornamented
porch attached. The interior is enriched with
twenty-four columns and pilasters, and also with
carving and gilding.</p>

<p>The mosque of Omar, called by the Arabs <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">El
Sakhara</i>, or the “Locked-up,” owes its high sanctity
to a large stone in the centre, apparently a portion
of the native rock of the mountain. It is rough as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
when hewn from the quarry, is surrounded by a
wooden railing about four feet high, and covered by
a cloth of green stuff and satin. This is the <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Hadjr-el-Sakhara</i>,
or the “Locked-up stone.” The Turks
relate that it fell from heaven when the gift of prophecy
was bestowed on man, and was used as a
seat by the ancient men who were thus endowed.
But when the prophets were at length compelled
to abandon it and fly to other countries, the stone
showed also a disposition to take its departure; on
which the archangel Gabriel came, and, grasping it
with his hand, held it in its place until Mahomet had
flown from Mecca, and firmly attached it to the
mountain. The Caliph Omar afterwards built
around it the present mosque. They show on it
the marks of the archangel’s fingers, made in the
struggle to detain the rock.</p>

<p>Beneath the mosque is a cave about eighteen feet
square, with niches, called by the names of Abraham,
David, Solomon, Elias, Gabriel, and Mahomet,
but containing nothing remarkable.</p>

<p>In the south-eastern angle of the large court is
another edifice of an oblong shape, 162 feet in length
and 32 in width, called by the Turks <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">El Aksa</i>, and
used by them as a mosque. It is enriched by a great
number of columns within, but has a plain exterior;
the Latins say it was the church used in the Presentation,
but it probably belongs to the times of the
crusades.</p>

<p>Immediately without the court of the mosque of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Omar, on the north, is a rectangular pit, about 150
feet long and 40 wide, and 12 or 15 in depth,
walled around with hewn stones, evidently placed
there in very ancient times. It is called the Pool of
Bethesda; but though I should like to consider it
so, I know not of any sufficient evidence. The sides
are perpendicular, and the plan is altogether different
from that which the Scriptures would lead us
to expect. See John v. 2.</p>

<p>A little beyond the Pool of Bethesda we come to
the eastern gate of the modern city, called after St.
Stephen, from a belief that this proto-martyr met his
death on the slope, by which, just without this, we
descend to the brook of Kedron. A rock about half
way down the declivity, projects a little; and some
stains, produced by an oxide of iron in the rock, are
pointed out to the pilgrims as caused by his blood.</p>

<p>This gate is at present the only outlet on this side
of the city; but there was formerly another gate
opening from the court of the mosque, about 230
yards further south. It was called from its splendor
“the Golden Gate;” but it is now walled up, in consequence
of a tradition current among the Turks,
that the city will one day be taken by the Christians,
and that they will make their entrance through this
gate.</p>

<p>Connected with it is also a Christian legend, somewhat
fanciful, and of no bad moral, but destined to
little credit in these severe and searching times.</p>

<p>In the year 608 <a id="Ref_232"></a>Cosroes, king of Persia, conquered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Jerusalem; and after plundering the city and desecrating
the holy places, returned to his kingdom,
carrying back with him the true and venerated cross.
The emperor Heraclius, fourteen years after this,
was fortunate enough not only to regain possession
of the city, but following up his conquests, recovered
also the sacred relic. Returning to Jerusalem, his
intention was to enter the place by “the Golden
Gate;” and after having proceeded in grand cavalcade
to the churches, and having purified them, to
restore the cross to its original site. Attired in robes
all glittering with royal gems, and followed by a
long train of courtiers and nobles, he advanced with
gladness, and was about to enter through this
splendid gate, when an invisible but steady hand
pushed him back. Twice again he essayed to enter,
but as often was brought suddenly to a stand; nor
could any force succeed against this unseen and mysterious
power. At this moment Zacharias, the
patriarch of Jerusalem, came up; and seeing at once
how matters stood; exclaimed, “Say, O emperor,
art thou adorned with these splendid robes, and in this
triumphant procession,&mdash;art thou imitating <em>Him</em>
who, in humility and sorrow, bore on his shoulders
this sacred wood? Doff thy jewelled garments, put
on a coarse and humble dress, and quickly shalt thou
find an entrance, and be able to effect thy pious desires.”
The emperor hastened to comply, and the
invisible hand ceased to obstruct his way.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Valley of Hinnom. Potter’s field. Singular properties attributed
to its earth. Will not act on the citizens of Rome. Gloomy
character of the valley. Job’s well. Pool of Siloam. Fountain
of Siloam. Periodical in its flow. Stones and columns belonging
probably to the court of the ancient temple. Monuments of
Zachariah and Absalom. Tomb of Jehoshaphat. Burial-place
of the Jews. Valley of Jehoshaphat. View from the Mount of
Olives. Plain of Jordan, and the Dead Sea. Garden of Gethsemane.
Tomb of the Virgin. Tradition about her death and
ascension.</p>

<p>Another interesting excursion was along the
valley of Hinnom or Gehenna, thence up the valley
of Kedron, or, as I shall hereafter call it, of Jehoshaphat,
(its present name,) to the summit of the Mount
of Olives, and to the reputed Garden of Gethsemane.</p>

<p>We left the city by the Jaffa gate, and began immediately
to descend into the first of these valleys,
which here widens considerably and then terminates.
At the distance of about 500 feet from the extremity
we came to a causeway, stretching quite across,
and supposed to be an ancient embankment for confining
waters that were discharged from an aqueduct
still to be seen in the rocks above. This aqueduct
may be traced for some distance on the
western side of the valley where the rocks have in
some places been cut with great labor to make way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
for it; it passes on towards Bethlehem, and I was informed,
has its commencement at the Reservoirs of
Solomon, about two miles beyond that city. This
causeway and aqueduct probably belong to the very
few remnants of the ancient Jerusalem now to be
seen.</p>

<p>Our road laid near the bottom of the valley, upon
the debris of the ancient Jerusalem, consisting of loose
earth mingled with pottery; immediately over us, on
the left, rose the frowning battlement of the city; on
the right at the distance of about 200 feet were the
perpendicular cliffs which on that side bounded the
valley; they are composed of parallel strata of limestone,
and are pierced with numerous sepulchral
caves belonging to the times of the Jewish ascendancy.
Near the bend of the valley, in a recess among
the cliffs, was pointed out the spot supposed to be the
Aceldama or field of blood. It belongs now to the
Armenians, and if we are to believe numerous strong
affirmations, the soil has the property, miraculously
bestowed, of destroying the flesh of any body deposited
in it in the short space of twenty-four hours.
Earth from this place has been transported both to
the famous Campo Santo at Pisa in Italy, and to
Rome; and in both is said to retain its miraculous
properties, with the single exception, that in the latter
city, though it acts on the corpses of strangers, instead
of eating, it indignantly thrusts out from it the
bodies of the citizens themselves. For this distinction
the Romans have to thank themselves. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
earth was sent to them in 270 ships by Helena (or
St. Helena according to the Roman calendar), who
expected that it would be joyfully received. On its
arrival, the strangers then in the city joyfully proffered
their services in assisting to unload it, but the
citizens took the liberty of declining, saying that
they had already sacred earth enough, since the
whole of their soil had been consecrated by the
blood of the numerous martyrs who had suffered
there. “For which act of contempt it is permitted
of heaven, that if the body of any Roman is interred
in the Campo Santo of Rome, the earth thrusts it
out, fœted and deformed, but operates on that of a
stranger as has just been related. There are many
books which treat on this subject; and when I was
myself in Rome, I inquired with great diligence into
it, so as to inform myself about the matter; and all
affirmed it to be the fact.”<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>This valley, which had presented a somewhat
cheerful aspect at its upper extremity, became more
sombre as we advanced; and our path, winding at
last among large fragments of stones, was tiresome
enough. We had lost sight of the city walls; the
hill on our left was solitary and deserted, and around
us were the ruins of habitations that had once
covered it; the vegetation that had carpeted the bottom
of the valley higher up had now ceased, and on
our right were the rude large cliffs of the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
precipice. The scene was adapted to recall to our
minds the ancient times when parents here caused
their children to pass through the fire to Molech; it
was a place well suited to such abominations. The
valley is about a mile and a quarter in length; and,
wearied with its rudeness and dreary solitude, we
were glad when we emerged at last into the more
open valley of Jehoshaphat, and found ourselves in
a wide space, and by a well of cool delicious water.
It is called Job’s well, from a tradition that Job, when
recovering from his diseases, came and facilitated
his cure by washing here.</p>

<p>The valleys both of Hinnom and Jehoshaphat
were quite dry at the time of our visit, but the numerous
rounded pebbles in the bottom, particularly
of the latter, gave evidence of rapid torrents in the
rainy season.</p>

<p>Following up the latter valley on the western
side, we came, at the distance of about 1200 feet from
Job’s well, to the outlet of the valley of Siloam, and
our road was here crossed by the first stream of water
that we had seen any where in or about Jerusalem;
it is a mere streamlet however, a few drops oozing
among the clods, and these soon lost in the thirsty
soil. They come from the <em>Pool of Siloam</em>, which
was a hundred yards on our left, and presents
a chamber once apparently arched, and walled on
either side, but open at the lower end, while from
the upper part of the other extremity, a small stream
drops in a light cascade, and forms a pool below,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
still much resorted to for water and for washing.
Whether it presents the same appearance as in
ancient times it is impossible to say; but there can
be no doubt that the site is exactly that<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of the pool
to which the man blind from his birth was sent to
wash, and whence he returned with his sight restored.
There is great satisfaction in being able to
identify a spot so highly interesting, and connected
with such tender associations as this.</p>

<p>About 150 yards further on, as we were passing
along the steep descent to the valley of Jehoshaphat,
an opening in the rock suddenly presented itself on
our left, and we found here the <em>Fountain</em> of Siloam&mdash;the
spot from which the <em>Pool</em> is said to draw, by
a subterranean channel, its supply of water. It is
called the Virgin’s Fountain, from a tradition that
she used to resort to it frequently, and its waters are
still used for diseases of the eye. It may, perhaps, have
some medicinal qualities; for it is brackish, and not
very pleasant to the taste. The fountain is subterranean,
and is reached by a descent of thirty steps cut in
the solid rock. At my first visit the water was gushing
out at the bottom of this in a full stream as clear as
crystal, and in this land of drought was really
an attractive object. At my second visit, I could
scarcely recognize it to be the same. The flow had
ceased, and it was a stagnant pool; which a lad, filling
some jars on a donkey alone, had defiled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sediment so as to give it a yellow muddy color. Its
flow is periodical, and my visits must have been at
times when the phenomenon is most striking in its
operation. The waters of the Pool of Siloam have
always been represented as sweet and pleasant, and
those of this fountain are brackish. Can the former
be supplied from this? It appeared to me also that
the latter is lower than the <em>Pool</em> of Siloam; but my
time did not allow me to settle the question. The
water is conducted off from it by a subterranean
channel deeply sunk in the hill.</p>

<p>Not far from this fountain is the south-eastern
angle of the present city; and the wall here,
projecting a little into the valley, is on this account
about twice the usual height. Even at a
distance our attention is attracted by some remarkable
stones at this corner; and an examination satisfied
me that they belonged to the ancient Jerusalem.
I have frequently been asked, since my return,
whether I could see any remains whatever of the
ancient temple. These stones probably did not
belong to the temple itself, but there is little doubt
in my mind that they were a part either of its cloisters,
or of the huge wall that supported its courts.
They are just at the foot of Mount Moriah, and are
in all respects quite different from the stones that
form the remainder of the present city wall. The
latter are of irregular shape and of no great dimensions,
such as are to be seen in any common wall.
These are all rectangular, with a remarkably fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
joint, and are sometimes of very great size; I
noticed some, the length of which would measure
twenty-one feet; and they were all of considerable
dimensions. Though the stones are of the common
compact limestone found northward of the city, the
joints are so closely fitted as to be perceptible only
on a close inspection. On the outer surface of each
stone, is a pannel, raised one fourth of an inch, and
approaching to within two inches of the joint; there
is an edifice at Baalbec, supposed to belong to the
time of Solomon, the stones of which are all ornamented
with a panelling similar to this; the castle
or citadel of Damascus is also in the same peculiar
style of architecture. Josephus, when speaking of
the wall that supported the court of the temple,
seems to refer to something like this when he tells
us that, although the stones were neatly fitted
together, yet “the vastness of the stones in the
front was plainly visible on the outside.”<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Built into the wall, at different elevations, from
this angle on to the Golden gate, are also a great
many columns, that appear to have belonged in
ancient times to some splendid edifice. They are
in a horizontal position; their extremities, which
alone are visible, projecting two or three inches
beyond the face of the wall. Some of them are of
verd-antique of remarkable beauty, some are of a common
kind of cipoline, and others are of a very handsome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
rose-colored marble. Their position, directly
under the site of the ancient temple, and their beauty,
lead me to think that they belonged once to the
courts of that splendid edifice.</p>

<p>In front of us, on the opposite side of the valley
of Jehoshaphat, were now two remarkable objects, and
descending, we crossed a bridge which here spanned
the dry channel of Kedron, in order to examine
them. They are two square monuments, lying about
thirty feet above the bottom of the valley, and seem
to be partly imbedded in the side of the Mount of
Olives. In fact they are cut out of that mountain,
being composed each of the solid undetached rock,
but isolated from the hill by a channel ten or twelve
feet wide, cut at the back and sides. They are
called the monuments of Zachariah and Absalom.</p>

<p>The first of these is ornamented on each face with
four semi-columns of the Ionic order, and a pilaster
at each angle, crowned by an entablature, making,
with the columns, an elevation of about twenty feet;
all of this is one solid piece of rock. The whole is
surmounted by a flat pyramid of masonry, the sides
of which are smooth, and come down to the edges
of the cubical mass. We can discover no opening of
any kind in this monument, though there is doubtless
a cavity beneath the pyramid.</p>

<p>The monument of Absalom stands about one
hundred feet north of this, and is nearly of the
same dimensions; the columns in this, however, are
of the Doric order, and with an entablature to correspond.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
These are also cut in the same mass of
rock, but are surmounted by a square block of
masonry edged with mouldings; this again by a
circular mass similarly enriched, and this by a sharp
pointed dome, which, finally, is crowned by a stone
ornament resembling a flame of fire. In the hinder
side of this monument is an opening about ten feet
from the ground, giving access to a chamber in it,
which is now nearly filled up with pebbles. Both
Mahomedans and Christians, as they pass along,
throw a pebble at the monument, to show their detestation
of the unfilial conduct of him whose name it
bears. The authority for calling it after Absalom
is in 2 Samuel xviii. 18. “Now Absalom in his
lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar,
which is in the king’s-dale, ‘for,’ he said, ‘I have
no son to keep my name in remembrance;’ and he
called the pillar after his own name; and it is called
unto this day Absalom’s Place.”</p>

<p>It has been conjectured that the columns and
other exterior ornaments are of more recent date
than the rest of the work; but the parts all correspond
so well, and harmonize also so well with the
shape and proportions of the main body of the
rock, that I can see no room for such an opinion.</p>

<p>Between the two monuments is a cave, called the
Tomb of Jehoshaphat, on what authority it would be
difficult to say; it consists of three chambers, one
of which borders on the front of the precipitous
rock in which they are situated, and is there adorned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
with two Doric columns, placed so as to support
the roof. Back of the tomb of Absalom the face
of the rock is also ornamented with scrolls and
other sculptures, in bas-relief, covering, apparently,
the entrance to a tomb cut in the mountain.</p>

<p>Turning here into a footpath that by zigzag lines
begins to ascend the Mount of Olives, we found
ourselves soon in a scene of pathetic interest. Yearning
ever after the holy land of his forefathers, the
Jew, as life begins to wear out, often collects together
his earnings, and rouses up his sinking strength to
carry him hither, that he may die in Jerusalem, and
have his bones laid beneath the mountain of the
ancient temple. They are not permitted to set foot
within the enclosure of Mount Moriah, but in pleasant
weather they may be seen just without the
outer wall, seated on the ground, and reading in
their devotional books; and even for this privilege
they have to pay the Turkish governor. Sad and
humbled people! They come hither from the ends
of the earth, and, excluded from the Holy Mountain,
sit down in the dust without its walls to mourn over
their desolations, and, cry, “Lord, how long, how
long?” And the mark that is set upon them follows
them, even in death. The Moslems occupy
the slope down into the valley of Jehoshaphat for
their own burying-place; and the Jews, desirous of
having the shadows of Moriah fall upon their graves,
have to take the opposite side of the valley along
the slopes of the Mount of Olives. The ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
there is whitened with the humble slabs that cover
their graves.</p>

<p>“And the Lord shall scatter thee among all
people, from one end of the earth even unto the
other; and among these nations shalt thou find no
ease, neither shall the sole of the foot have rest.”
The sleep of death! The graves of such a people
here by the relics of the ancient city, are a touching
spectacle!</p>

<p>The valley of Jehoshaphat, which takes its name
from the monument we have just been noticing, is
about two miles in length. It is the belief, both of
Mahomedans and of the eastern Christians, that the
Last Judgment will be held in this place. The
authority given by the latter is in Joel iii. 2 and 12.
“I will gather all nations, and will bring them
down into the valley of Jehoshaphat,” &amp;c.&mdash;“Let the
heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of
Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the
heathen round about.”</p>

<p>I have already, I believe, mentioned that the
Mount of Olives is about a mile in length, and about
seven hundred feet in height. To a spectator on
the west, it has a gently waving outline, and appears
to have three summits of nearly equal height. On
the top of the centre one is a Christian church,
erected over the spot where, they inform us, our
Saviour ascended into heaven; and, in confirmation
of the fact, point to a stone with the impression of
the left foot, made, as they say, as he was about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
leaving the earth; that of the right foot has been
carried away by the Turks. On Ascension day they
come up in great crowds, and have service here.
The chapel had been shaken down by the recent
earthquake, and the floor was covered by rubbish, so
that we did not see the stone, nor did we care about
it. In Luke xxiv. 50,<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> it is very clearly stated that
the ascension occurred near Bethany, which is on
the eastern side of the mountain, more than a mile
from this. The Turks have a similar tradition with
regard to Mahomet in connexion with this spot, and
close to the Christian chapel have a mosque, also
nearly laid in ruins by the earthquake.</p>

<p>From this central height a ridge stretches off
towards the east for a distance of three fourths of a
mile, when it terminates by a bold descent. We
were conducted to the end of it in order to enjoy
the view eastward, which is very extensive. The
plain of Jordan, the mountain beyond, the Dead Sea,
and the dark and singular chain of mountains on
the east of it, were in full view, as well as all the
country intermediate between them and us. Some
of us thought that they could see the waters of the
Jordan; but although this was uncertain, we could
easily trace the course of the river through the plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
by the verdure; and where this failed, by the broken
nature of the ground. Beyond it towered the
lofty mountains of Moab, rising peak above peak in
great majesty, including among them Mount Nebo;
and as I stood gazing upon them, I took pleasure in
repeating the hymn which I had often sung among
friends in my own father-land,</p>

<p class="center">“There is a land of pure delight.”</p>

<p>It had a been part of our design to visit the Jordan
and the Dead Sea; but the country was then filled
with bands of people driven from their homes by the
incursion of Ibrahim Pasha, and in a high state of
excitement, as well from disaffection to the government
as from their sufferings in consequence of the
war; and when we proposed this journey, the men
who owned our horses refused absolutely to let them
go. The Governor of Jerusalem said that a guard
of 300 men would be necessary, and offered to furnish
us with such an escort, if the Commodore desired
it; but this polite offer was of course declined.
So we made the most of our mountain view, which
was a very extensive one. The atmosphere in these
lands of scanty exhalations is so clear that the Dead
Sea and the Jordan appeared to be close to us, and
we wondered that the journey to them should be
esteemed so toilsome. But glancing at the country
between us and them, we saw hill succeeding hill,
till the detail swelled out into a distance of at least
thirty miles. The country below us was a scene of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
complete and utter desolation; the hills were bare
and red, and cut into deep ravines, and in the whole
stretch between us and the Dead Sea, scarcely a spot
of verdure could be seen. The mountains east of
that lake of death have a very unique aspect, rising
to a great height, and presenting an outline as smooth
and even as if they were an artificial wall.</p>

<p>It was a relief to turn from this dreary prospect to
the fertile and verdant mountain on which we were
then standing. And as we returned, and, gaining
the summit towards Jerusalem, looked down over
its graceful slopes, and at the city, all displayed before
us, no one could wonder that the Saviour often
sought the Mount of Olives for meditation; and that
the view around, then so varied, so rich, so beautiful,
and soon to be changed by a fearful war into utter
desolation, should incite to prayer.</p>

<p>The sun was now beginning to approach the
western horizon. We descended by a steep zigzag
path leading directly down towards the gate of St.
Stephen; and near the foot of the mountain, now
immersed in the broad shades of the city, came to a
spot, that, as soon as it was named, excited a universal
and powerful interest. It was the Garden of Gethsemane.
It lies near the foot of the mountain, at
an angle formed by the branching of the lower road
to Bethany and that to Jericho, by which we had
just been descending; and is marked by eight olive
trees, that look as if they may have stood almost as
many centuries. The Latins, to whom they belong,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
say, indeed, that they were here in the time of our
Saviour, and would punish with excommunication
any person of their order who should venture to
break a limb or otherwise injure them. They allow
pilgrims to peel off any loose pieces of bark that
they may find on the huge trunks; which accordingly
are kept white and raw looking by the frequency
of such visits. They are very large; and as
the olive tree is of very slow growth, there may be
some truth in the declaration, that the Turks, on regaining
the city from the Crusaders, having imposed
a yearly tax of ten cents on every olive tree then
standing, and half as much on any that should be
planted, the records of the monastery show that
the former sum was then paid for these trees; but as
to the statement that would carry their age to the
early times of Christianity, we cannot believe it; for
if the olive tree itself were ascertained to last so long,
we know that Titus had all the trees within several
leagues cut down<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> for the construction of banks and
instruments of assault.</p>

<p>As to the query whether this is the Garden of
Gethsemane, I do not see that we have any reason
for deciding in one way or the other, the notice of
its location in the Scriptures (and I believe we have
no others) being so very slight. The ground here
slopes off more gently than in most other places, and
is favorable for a garden; but it is quite near the
foot of the mountain, and I think the expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
(Luke xiv. 26.) “they went out <em>into</em> the Mount of
Olives,” would have led me to look for it higher up;
and it seems probable, also, that a spot more retired
than one so immediately adjoining the thronged city
would have been selected on such an occasion. But
these objections are not entitled to much weight,
and I feel loth to disturb the belief in a spot of such
tender interest. I broke off a few of the branches,
and gathered up some of the earth, which I have
brought home with me.</p>

<p>Although few of these places can be identified,
and all have changed, it was still a high gratification
to know that we were among scenes often blessed
by the presence of our Saviour and Lord; that here,
in this region, he had healed the sick, making joy
spring up in bosoms where it had been long a stranger;
here had given sight to the blind, and hearing
to the deaf, and had taught his pure and benevolent
doctrines; and that from the scenery around us, and
now in our sight, had drawn elucidations and found
the subjects for his parables.</p>

<p>About twenty paces northward from this, is a
cave twenty-five or thirty feet in diameter, to which we
descend, by eleven steps; and here they say our Lord
retired for prayer on this occasion; and they show
also the spot where the three disciples reclined and
slept.</p>

<p>Proceeding again to the northward, we come, at
the distance of thirty yards, to a large subterranean
chamber called the Tomb of the Virgin. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
lighted up for us; and having descended by a noble
flight of steps, fifty in number, and twenty feet wide,
cut in the solid rock, we found ourselves in a lofty
apartment, branching off into small chambers on the
right and left. The latter chamber is used as a chapel
by the Copts, while in the other is the reputed
Tomb of the Virgin, together with an altar. On
either side of the flight of steps, about half way
down, is also a recess, containing the reputed tombs
of her parents, Joachim and Anna, and of Joseph
the husband of Mary. This region is fruitful in
traditions connected with the virgin and the apostles;
but I pass them by, with the exception of one
that is so full of poetry that I trust I shall be pardoned
for noticing it.</p>

<p>The Virgin being sick, and now at the point of
death, prayed her Son that the apostles might all be
permitted to be present at her departure; and they
were accordingly transported in a moment from all
parts of the world, whither they had travelled
preaching the gospel; and found themselves together
by her bedside at Jerusalem; all except Thomas,
who by a particular judgment was left behind.</p>

<p>She died, and was buried by the apostles in this
spacious tomb, which they left not for three days
and nights; during all which time sweet music from
unseen angelic harps was floating amid the vaults
and through the air above. At the end of this time,
Thomas was placed among them, and was disconsolate
when he found he had been denied the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of witnessing her death. He begged, however, that
as he had not been allowed to see her while yet
alive, he might be permitted to look at the corpse;
they complied, and the tomb was opened for him;
but the body was gone, nothing remaining but the
grave clothes and winding sheet. At the same time
the music of the angels ceased, by which they knew
that the body was ascending to heaven. Thomas,
with tears, gazed upward, and caught a glimpse of
the ascending form; and to comfort him she dropped
for him a girdle of marvellous beauty, which fell
upon a rock adjoining the tomb; “which rock,” says
the book, “is held in the greatest veneration by all
persons, and has granted for it indulgences, like
those of the other sacred places of Jerusalem.”<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Maundrell says of this stone, that there is “a
winding channel upon it, which they will have to be
the impression of the girdle when it fell, and to be
left for the conviction of all such as shall suspect the
truth of their story.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Visit to the Mount of Olives to procure olive root. Cabinet work
from it. Attempt, by a Fancy spell, to raise up again the ancient
city of Jerusalem. Its appearance. Fortifications. Towers.
Royal palace. Stupendous wall supporting the Courts of the

<p>The olive root makes beautiful cabinet work;
and, desirous of procuring some from the Mount of
Olives to be worked up for my friends, I took one
day an interpreter and a couple of natives, and
ascended the mountain to see if I could purchase
some. Southward of Absalom’s monument is the
village of Siloa, standing in what appears to have
been a quarry; and consisting partly of houses
erected on the rocky platforms, and in part of caves
cut in the side of the declivity. This was quite
deserted; but near the summit of the mountain I
was fortunate enough to find a house with occupants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
from whom I purchased the privilege of cutting
some roots.<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It may afford an idea of the state of
the arts at Jerusalem, when I mention that the best
axe which we could find in the city was a species
of blunt grubbing-hoe; and that we actually grubbed
through the thick roots; and this, they informed me,
is the usual way of cutting wood in that country.
Mr. Nicholayson had owned an English axe, but
his Arab guards had carried it off at the conclusion
of the siege.</p>

<p>Soon after commencing operations on the trees,
we found ourselves surrounded by a dozen wild
looking men, who seemed to have started up from
beneath the ground, where probably they had been
concealed in the caves and artificial pits with which
the country abounds. They were induced, by the
offer of a trifling compensation, to assist us; and
while they were tugging away at the wood, I sat down
a few yards off to make some plans and sketches of
the city. In half an hour the interpreter came to
say that they had all fled; and on returning I found
that not an individual of them was to be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The soldiers at the city gate below had spied them
out with their glasses, and a detachment had been sent
up to seize them; but they were too cunning, and
escaped; and as we stood by the tree, we heard
them, in their flight, calling to the soldiers, and using
epithets that were any thing but complimentary.
I have introduced this simple circumstance, however,
not so much for its own sake, as to give me an
opportunity of carrying the reader once more to the
top of the Mount of Olives. And here I wish him
to sit down at the spot which I have just been
occupying on the central eminence, and gaze down
on this place of wonderful history, and of tender
and thrilling association. But my object is not to
speak of the present city of Jerusalem; I wish to
blot out all that picture, defaced in so many places
by wretchedness and unsightly ruins, and to place
before his imagination the ancient city of Jerusalem,
when she sat upon these hills in her jewelled ornaments,&mdash;when
“glorious things were spoken of thee,
O city of God.”</p>

<p>Often as that city is upon our lips, I believe there
are few persons who have an idea of its extraordinary
splendor in the olden times; for it was a place
not only unique, and of strange religious interest,
but also of wonderful magnificence. The period
of Solomon’s reign might perhaps be selected as that
when its effect was most imposing; but I prefer for
our picture the time, of the Agrippas, because, while
the splendor of Jerusalem was scarcely less than in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the reign of Solomon, we have, by the aid of Josephus,
more ample materials for forming a judgment of its
appearance; and this, too, with a slight exception, was
the city whose streets our Saviour trod, and over which,
while observing it from a spot just below us here on
the Mount of Olives, he wept in the sad anticipation
of its downfall.</p>

<p>And now look northward, and westward, and
southward, and notice how, from these distant heights,
the land slopes gently downward; bending hitherward
as if in reverence, and to add dignity to the
consecrated spot. Now look downward. Behold
now I spread over the place the spell of a sober and
chastened Fancy. I call up again the buried objects
of other days. City of the olden time&mdash;arise!</p>

<p>See, this is the ancient Jerusalem!</p>

<p>Truly it is a magnificent place; a picture of rare
and exquisite beauty set in a frame of brilliants. Recovered
from our surprise, and the eye having grown more
familiar with the unique spectacle, we turn now to
examine it in detail. And, first, observe the walls by
which it is begirt; what a proud and formidable
array of strength is here. The massive battlements
seem to set all earthly power at defiance, while the
stones of immense size excite our wonder, not only
by their prodigious size, but by their peculiar and
careful finish. That wall on the north is eighteen
feet in thickness, and with its battlements and turrets
is forty-five feet in height; it runs zigzag, so that
each part may be raked from the towers, of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
there are ninety in this wall. The towers, thirty-six
feet square, are of solid masonry, and are crowned
each with two stories or suites of rooms, in which
architectural beauty is consulted as well as strength,
and which are of great magnificence. The angles
in the wall are acute, receding considerably from the
towers; and the whole structure, as it sweeps around
the city, looks like a mountain of solid and immoveable
rock. At its north-western angle, high above
all the rest, rises the tower of Psephinus, massive
below, but in its upper part marked by graceful,
though still heavy architecture; it is octangular, and
attains an elevation of one hundred and twenty-seven
feet.</p>

<p>Within this, separating Acra from Bezetha, is
another wall, a solid mountain of masonry, presenting
high angular walls, battlements, and towers of
exceeding strength; and here, south of Acra, on the
edge of Zion, is a third line of similar defences, making,
with the steepness of the ascent, a bulwark by no means
less formidable than the rest; and on the southern and
western sides of this mountain, grow up from the
edge of the high rocky precipice, by which it is there
begirt, lines of broad and high stone-work, presenting
an utterly hopeless barrier to an assailant. “Walk
about Zion, and go round about her; tell the towers
thereof; mark ye well her bulwarks; beautiful for
situation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion.
The kings were assembled, they passed by together;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
they saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled,
and hasted away.”</p>

<p>The chief glory of these defences of Zion, however,
is a nest of towers there at the north-west angle,
“which, for largeness, beauty, and strength, are beyond
all that are in the habitable earth.” They were
built by Herod, and called after his friend, his
brother, and his wife. They stand at a point where
the elevation of Mount Zion, contracting into narrow
limits, becomes more remarkable, and thus presents
their altitude and elaborate architectural
beauties in a more striking point of view. One of
them is placed in the sharp angle, and is called the
tower of Hippicus. It is 46 feet square; and to
an elevation of 55 feet is composed of firm and
solid masonry, the stones with which it is built
being 36 feet in length, by eighteen in width,
and nine in height; above this enduring mass is a
reservoir 36 feet in elevation; next above this
is a double range of magnificent chambers of ornamental
yet massive architecture, making an additional
height of 46 feet; and above these rise
battlements and turrets, the whole height of the
tower being 146 feet.</p>

<p>A short distance from it we behold the tower Phasaelus,
72 feet square and 164 in height. Seventy-two
feet of this elevation consists of stones like those
in the tower just described; and the rest is composed
of heavy stone work faced with colonnades; of richly
ornamented chambers, and of battlements and turrets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The third tower of Mariamne, named by Herod
after his wife, is smaller than these, but of exquisite
beauty, and richly adorned with ornaments; it attains
an elevation of 91 feet.</p>

<p>All these look immediately down upon the royal
palace, also on Mount Zion; and here the eye is
wearied with tracing the labyrinth of courts, the
succession of porticos adorned with rich and curious
pillars, the ranges of lofty windows, giving
light to halls where statuary and carved work have
added their embellishments, and where the vessels
are of silver and gold. And in the courts below and in
the gardens are rare trees, and fountains, and brazen
statues, and winding streams. No cost or skill has
been spared in this palace by a prince whose resources
were of the most ample kind. These palaces
and courts and towers are the <em>Kremlin</em> of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Observe now that long bridge, with its lofty
arches, a striking feature in this scene, and adding
greatly to its picturesque effect. It rises high above
the dwellings of Acra, and, stretching quite across
that portion of the city, connects the precincts of
this palace with the Temple. But let us hasten to
turn our attention to the Temple. The city has yet
many striking objects that solicit our attention; the
lofty and frowning castle of Antonia, palaces in great
numbers, private edifices of remarkable architecture,
brought out into strong relief by the uneven nature of
the ground, invite our notice; but the wonderful
Temple, grand, mysterious, awful, is here before us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and the eye glances impatiently at other objects. Let
us turn then, and suffer our eyes to dwell and feast
on this.</p>

<p>And it is indeed a glorious sight. It stands here
all before us, the walls that support its courts rising
from the very depths of the valley of Jehoshaphat,
and towering aloft to an astonishing, a giddy height.
It was a bold and daring conception&mdash;that of carrying
up this mountain of stone-work to such a stupendous
elevation. This wall here fronting us is
729 feet in height!<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> On the northern and western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
sides, owing to the inequality of the ground, the
elevation is somewhat less.</p>

<p>You perceive that in order to obtain greater strength,
the walls are not perpendicular, but somewhat slanting,
so that with the ascending nature of the ground
in the courts above, the whole structure has somewhat
of a pyramidal form. The stones of which it is composed
are of prodigious size, yet are fitted together
with the greatest care, and in addition to the security
afforded by their magnitude, are strengthened
internally by means of iron clamps. This wall is
above 730 feet in length on each side; it forms an
exact square, and the whole interior space being
filled up, we have thus a vast mountain raised by
human labor, a stupendous structure that must excite
the astonishment of all succeeding ages. But
this is only the ground work, the substructure for
the great Temple and its sacred courts. Look upward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
now; you see along the edge of this wall, far
up at its giddy elevation, where the brain reels as it
attempts to measure the depths below, you see a cloister
or ornamented colonnade, on the outside ornamented
with architectural embellishment, and yet
more remarkable still for massiveness and strength,
as if to guard from the assaults even of the wildest
fancy the sacred precincts of the Temple. This cloister
is 55 feet wide, and consists on the outside of a
range of chambers, and within or towards the Temple,
of a double row of marble columns 46 feet in
height, each column consisting of a single block of
white marble; the entablature gives to the whole
cloister or colonnade an elevation of more than 60
feet. At the southern end, instead of two, are four
rows of columns, each column six feet in diameter
and 27 in height; the heaviness of the shaft being
relieved by fanciful flutings at the base, and by rich
leaf-shaped capitals, like those which we consider as
belonging to the Corinthian order. This end is
called Solomon’s Porch;<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> it consists of a nave, if I
may use the term, 45 feet wide, and in height 100
feet, with side aisles, each 30 feet wide, and 50 in
height. It is an enchanting spot, and fanned at that
high elevation with a perpetual breeze, and is a favorite
resort; but, indeed, where, in this whole colonnade,
forming a complete circuit of 2900 feet, is a spot that
is not marked by exceeding beauty and magnificence?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
At each angle you perceive towers of elaborate
architecture, crowned with turrets or pinnacles,
where, gazing downward, the senses recoil with
horror from the frightful depth.</p>

<p>But this is only the commencement of the grandeur
of this wonderful Temple. Within this cloister
is an open court, running also quite around; it
is paved with marble, and its level is broken by a
few steps of ascent, also passing along the whole
circuit of the court. This is the court of the Gentiles;
and inscriptions on columns are seen at intervals,
forbidding this class of people to advance
nearer to the Temple. Along the inner edge of this
court runs another cloister, consisting also of a row
of chambers, with a single colonnade in the interior,
or looking toward the Temple. In the space allotted
here to the chambers, the ground has taken
an ascent of seventeen feet from the court of the Gentiles,
but the colonnade itself is on level ground, the
pillars being, as in the outer colonnade, forty-six
feet in height, and making, with the entablature,
likewise a full elevation of more than sixty feet; but
from the rise of the ground this colonnade is twenty
feet higher than the other.</p>

<p>In this cloister, fronting us on the east, is the
“Beautiful Gate;”<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and truly, no one need be directed
to mark its surpassing magnificence. It is ninety-one
feet in height by seventy-three in width; the doors are
of massive Corinthian brass, covered on both sides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
as are also the jambs and lintels, with plates of gold
and silver, sometimes plain, sometimes in fretted
work, or raised into figures in low or in high relief.
On either side of the doorway is a tower, seventy-three
feet high, adorned with columns twenty-one
feet in circumference. On the northern and southern
sides of this cloister are eight other gates, of less
magnitude, but covered in a similar manner, as are
also their jambs and lintels, with plates of gold and
silver; and strengthened also like the former, with
towers and massive columns.</p>

<p>Passing through this, we are once more in an open
court, paved with marble, and rising by steps towards
the central point. The eastern side of this court is
allotted to the worship of the Jewish women, while
that on the north and south is divided off for the
men. At the inner edge of this court is again another
wall; it is of marble, only a few feet in height, and is
richly ornamented with sculpture; it separates the
court of the Jewish worshippers from the inmost
court of all, the court of the Priests.</p>

<p>And there, at the eastern side of this inmost court,
in the open air, at the apex of this stupendous Pyramidal
structure, canopied only by the heavens, stands
the Altar of Burnt Sacrifice. It is a colossal structure,
being twenty-seven feet in height and ninety-one
feet on each of its sides. The ascent is by an
inclined plane on the south.</p>

<p>And just beyond it, is the TEMPLE. This looks
also to the eastward, and as we attempt to gaze upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
it in this bright morning sun, now darting its rays
across the Mount of Olives, our dazzled eyes turn
away, pained by the glorious sight. It presents a
front one hundred and eighty-two feet long and of
an equal height, <em>all of which is covered with thick
plates of gold</em>. What a magnificent spectacle!
What a grand termination to this stupendous structure,
towering upwards from the deep valley towards
the clouds. Cast your eye downwards, and let it
range over the immense masses of chiselled rocks,
wrought into regular shape, enriched with architectural
device, and piled on each other till the senses
are pained in endeavoring to take in the colossal
fabric of more than seven hundred feet in height;
glance at the huge mouldings into which the wall
swells at its termination; mark the high colonnades
of pure showy marble, that are ranged along the
edge of this mighty structure; see within this the
marble tesselated pavement, ascending by flights of
steps, and encircling the mountain; and then again
another range of light marble porticos sweeping
quite around; mark the pavement, again ascending
by unbroken flights of marble steps; and here, at
length, crowning the whole magnificent work, is the
gorgeous Temple, its front one hundred and eighty-two
feet high, decked with elaborate architectural
embellishments, and covered with massive gold.</p>

<p>And “the Lord is in his Holy Temple, let all the
earth keep silence before Him.”</p>

<p>Yes, in this gorgeous edifice, raised to such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
stupendous height, wrapped in a splendor that the
eye can scarcely look upon; deep within the edifice
in a spot of mysterious darkness and solitude, is
shadowed forth the presence of Jehovah; and this
Temple belongs not to Jerusalem, but to the whole
world. And He, the Deity, whose very name is
awful, and should be used with reverence, hath
blessed this spot with his peculiar presence; and it
is meet that man should look upon it with deep and
solemn feeling. “How amiable,” said the Psalmist,
when far distant, “how amiable are thy tabernacles,
O Lord of Hosts. My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth,
for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my
flesh crieth out for the living God. For a day in thy
courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell
in the tents of wickedness.”</p>

<p>In this eastern front of the Temple is an open and
ornamented door-way, 46 feet wide and 128 feet in
height. The architect of this edifice was a man of
skill. He knew well the powerful effect produced
by the prevalence of high ascending lines in a building,
and in the Temple he has taken advantage of
this effect, and with the best results. How fine is
the appearance of this grand and lofty door-way,
open also so as to give a view of the rich vestibule
just within! Our thoughts and our feelings, whatever
they may be, are not checked at the very threshhold,
but are allowed to penetrate to a short distance;
they are not excluded from the edifice; they enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
sufficiently to make us a part of it; and yet it is not
made common by being all exposed; sufficient of it
remains shut up to excite our wonder, to cherish
feelings of respect, to inspire that awe which arises
from mystery.</p>

<p>He who may enter this lofty door-way, will find
himself in a vestibule at right angles with his path;
it is 36 feet wide, 92 in length, and 164 feet in height.
The wall in front of him is all covered with plates of
gold, which, like that on the exterior front, is in various
forms, smooth and highly burnished, or in
patterns of embossed work, or in figures of various
kinds. From the lofty ceiling, which the eye is
pained in attempting to reach, hangs down a golden
vine, with leaves and fruit of the same metal, and so
colossal are its dimensions, that the clusters of grapes
are six feet in length.<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Our foot may not be placed
within this vestibule; but through the large open
door-way we can discover much of the splendor by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
which it is distinguished. In the golden wall that
bounds our vision at its further side, is a door-way
twenty-nine feet wide by 100 in height, covered by
a Babylonian curtain, of blue and scarlet and purple,
richly embroidered, and of wonderful workmanship.
Its ample folds conceal a door, which, like the wall,
is covered with plates of gold, plain or in various
patterns, and of exceeding richness.</p>

<p>He who enters this door will find himself in <em>The
Sanctuary</em>. This is a chamber thirty-six feet wide and
seventy-two in length, and 109 in height; its height,
however, cannot be reached by the eye; for this
chamber is in darkness, except the obscure light shed
upon it by several lamps. Daylight cannot penetrate
it, unless occasionally a feeble glimmering
through the door-way; a mysterious obscurity is left
to pervade it, and the vision, turning upward, combats
for a while the deepening shadows, and is then repelled
by utter darkness. The furniture of this room
is simple, for it contains only the Table of Shew-bread,
and the Golden Candlestick, and the Altar of
Incense. While the incense ascends silently, and
keeps the chamber filled with perpetual odours, the
softened light of the Seven Golden Lamps of the
Candlestick falls upon a table with twelve loaves of
bread, one for each tribe; as if, by this simple emblem,
the staff of his life kept here in memorial, man
would gratefully acknowledge by whom his existence
is prolonged, and whence are derived its blessings.
There is something in this quiet and simple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
scene, a subdued and humble, yet grateful character
in its speech, that is very impressive.</p>

<p>At the further end of this chamber is again a door-way
covered by a thick veil of many folds. It opens
into a square chamber thirty-six feet on each side,
and 109 in height. In this chamber there is nothing
at all. <em>It is quite dark</em>; and its deep obscurity and
its vacancy are fit emblems of HIM who is invisible
to mortal eye, and whom mortal thought can never
reach. This is the Holy of Holies. It is entered
only by the High Priest, and by him but once a year.
Unadorned, and deeply shut up within the Temple,
it is left to darkness, and silence, and impressive
solitude.</p>

<p>When Pompey, after a toilsome siege, at length
took this mountain by assault, he hastened to the
Temple, incited both by curiosity, and by a desire to
feed his eye on the wealth that had at length become
his own; but when, having examined the Sanctuary
in its dim mysterious light, and then, raising this
veil, he stood in the Holy of Holies, and found no
object, nought but an obscurity that his eye, as he
gazed upward, sought in vain to pierce, a feeling of
awe and dread seems to have come upon him; he
left the Temple, having touched neither its furniture
nor its treasure, and, calling off his troops, he gave
orders to repair the injuries that had been occasioned
by his assault.</p>

<p>The walls of this building are fourteen and a half
feet in thickness, and are composed of stones forty-six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
feet long by twenty-one in width, and fourteen
in thickness, interspersed with some that have the
astonishing length of eighty-two feet.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The main
body of the edifice, containing the Sanctuary and the
Holy of Holies, is so narrow in proportion to its elevation,
that it would be in danger from earthquakes
if that were not guarded against by an outer wall nine
feet from this, with which it is connected so as to form
between them three tiers of cells, thirty in each tier;
the upper part of the building is used as store-rooms
for the furniture and utensils of the Temple. The
vestibule, being at right angles with the body of the
edifice, projects thirty-six feet on either side. The
stone employed here appears to be a pure white marble,
for those portions of the building which are not
covered with plates of gold are of dazzling whiteness,
so as to appear at a distance like a mountain covered
with snow.</p>

<p>The whole mass, the foundation walls, the porticoes,
the Temple, are indeed a wonderful structure; and
with the sacred and solemn associations connected
with them, form an object of surpassing interest and
grandeur.</p>

<p>And now look down again upon the city and upon
the fair region stretching all around. The ground
on which Jerusalem is built, assists greatly, as you
perceive, in giving it architectural effect. Babylon,
Nineveh, Thebes, Memphis, those cities of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
renown, were built on level plains, and with all their
riches and greatness were in most parts tame
and monotonous; but here the picturesque is added
to greatness and splendor; the walls and towers overhang
deep precipices; the lofty palaces are brought
into stronger relief by their situations; each portion
of the city, by harmony or by contrast, adds a charm
to every other; and the Temple, like another sun
chained to the dizzy heights of Moriah, sheds an effulgence
over all.</p>

<p>Gaze now around. What a frame-work is there
for the city of Jerusalem! See the villages, embosomed
in gardens of deep verdure, sprinkled thickly
over all the plains, which, ascending as they retire
from the city, expose every object to our view. Here
the houses stand in thick clusters, there they straggle
along amid the overhanging trees; and the whole
immense extent of country seems only a continuation
of the city in a more cheerful form. And this Mount
of Olives, what a beautiful object it must be when
viewed from the city. Its graceful slopes, its gardens,
its deep shade, its white cottages, its villas, where the
wealthy love to retire, half exposed, half concealed,
by the dense verdure; its groves and public walks;
what an admirable picture they form; and alongside
of the stupendous and glittering pyramid of Mount
Moriah, each by contrast gives new beauties and
new charms to the other. Where in all the world
shall we find a scene equal to this?</p>

<p>And now glance your eye along these roads that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
come winding over the hills by which Jerusalem is
encircled. See! The whole country seems awakened
into an intensity of life and animation. <em>It is the
Passover.</em> Far off as the eye can reach, the great
highways and the narrow paths are covered with
masses of living beings, thousands upon thousands
pouring onwards, and still succeeded by other thousands,
till it seems as if the whole habitable globe
was sending its inhabitants and its tribute to this
sacred city. And it does. Here are “Parthians and
Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia,
and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and
Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the
parts of Lybia about Greece, and strangers of Rome,
and Cretes, and Arabians,” in their various costumes,
and speaking their various tongues. The number
that assembles here on this occasion is about three
millions. They come, some purely from religious
feeling, some also for commerce; for the occasion is
seized by dwellers in far distant countries for the
interchange of commodities. As they approach the
city, however, a common feeling takes possession of all
of them, delight, reverence, awe, wonder, admiration.
As they gain the summits of the distant hills, and
catch a view of the Temple, they burst into shouts
of joy, they prostrate themselves upon the ground,
they break out into hymns of praise. The air
seems burdened by the noises that unceasingly ascend;
one while they are like the roar of the ocean;
at another, they rise, and sink, and swell upward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
again into lofty strains of wonder and thanksgiving;
the earth trembles under the moving to and fro of
these countless multitudes. See&mdash;still they come,
thousands and yet still countless thousands pressing
onward towards the city. The eye is wearied with
beholding them; the senses are pained and overwhelmed.</p>

<p>And now the sounds abate and sink into a deep but
continuous murmur. They are preparing for the
Paschal sacrifice. The multitudes are divided into
companies of from ten to twenty, and each company,
by a deputy appointed for that purpose, is to offer
in the courts of the temple a lamb without blemish
or spot; the blood is to be sprinkled at the foot of
the great altar, and the fat is to be cast upon it for a
burnt offering. There will be 250,000 of these sacrifices.</p>

<p>See! the courts of the Temple, the flat roofs of the
colonnades, are covered by the dense throngs; the
walls and towers of the city, the terraces of the
lofty dwellings of Jerusalem, are crowded by the
multitudes; and the ascending plains around, and the
slopes of the Mount of Olives, are all animated; it
is an ocean of living beings.</p>

<p>And now they are silent all. Soon you will perceive
a great cloud of smoke roll up from the altar and
envelope the Temple, and then you will hear their
hymns. There it is! and astounding! the millions
of voices that ascend seem to burst the very heavens;
the mountain shakes under the strange concussion.&mdash;Their
Hymn.&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It is a wonderful city, wonderful in its origin, in its
history, in its present character; strange events, too,
have been foretelling its doom, and terrible is to be
its downfall.</p>

<p>A flaming sword was seen night after night, for the
space of a year, suspended over the city; the inhabitants
crowded to the Temple, they offered sacrifices,
but still that bloody sword was over them; the timid
buried themselves in their chambers and wept; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
gay tried to forget it in debauch, but still it hung
above the city, and the hearts of the stoutest at length
quailed before it. It has lately disappeared, but they
do not know whether to consider this as an omen
for good or for evil.</p>

<p>Also the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, which
requires twenty men to move it, one night, though
secured by heavy bolts, opened of its own accord,
as if to show that the spirits which had been keeping
guard in the Temple were leaving it.</p>

<p>Also one night at Pentecost, as the priests were
going to their duties in the inner court of the Temple,
they felt a quaking of the earth, and then, as
they stood to recover from their dread, they heard a
whispering noise as of a multitude of people, saying,
“<em>Let us go hence.</em>”</p>

<p>Even now, as we have been sitting here, a lonely
and mournful, but loud voice, has been repeating in
the lanes and in the high streets of the city, “Wo, wo
to Jerusalem!” And for four years, by day and in
the deep stillness of night, that melancholy cry has
been unceasingly heard denouncing wo to the affrighted
and cowering inhabitants. A plain countryman
came up to the Feast of Tabernacles four years ago
while the country was prosperous and at peace;
and while engaged in the duties of this occasion
became suddenly a changed man, and before the
multitudes cried aloud, “A voice from the east, a
voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a
voice against Jerusalem and the Holy House, a voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
against the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice
against this whole people!” A dead weight of fear
has ever since lain upon the spirits of the inhabitants,
crushing the timid, and oppressing even the boldest.
They have tried by every means to stop his mournful
cry; they have beaten him till his bones were laid
bare, but he made no supplication and shed no
tears; they have carried him before the rulers, but
he has not been awed to silence, nor to their
queries and threats has he made any reply; he has
associated with no one, but in the crowded city has
made himself a solitary and a lonely man; he has
not complained when ill treated and abused from
day to day; he has not thanked those who gave him
food; to each he has replied only by his usual exclamation
of, wo to the city; the channels of all feeling,
except a deep and dreadful horror, seem to have
been frozen up. He rests but little; something
within him hath murdered sleep. At midnight,
when all nature is hushed in death-like repose,
from amid the deep darkness his mournful voice
is heard; and the mother starts and draws her
infant to her breast, and the sentry on his post
trembles at the prolonged and melancholy cry,
“Wo, wo, wo to Jerusalem!”</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th we started for Bethlehem,
which lies at the distance of about five miles from
Jerusalem on the south. Leaving by the Jaffa gate, and
crossing by difficult paths the valley of Hinnom, we
had then before us an elevated plain bordered eastwardly
by the valley of Jehoshaphat, about two miles
wide, and extending three miles toward the south,
in which direction it has a slight ascent. As we
passed on, a troop of cavalry, which had been out
at their morning drill, came sweeping along on our
left; but when they had passed us, we were left alone
in the open country, where scarcely a sign of cultivation
appeared. A blight has for a great many years
been upon this doomed and unhappy land. At the
distance of about two miles from the city, we came
to a well, called “the well of the kings,” or, “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
well of the star,” from a tradition that when the wise
men had left Jerusalem for Bethlehem, and had
reached this place, the star (Matthew ii. 9.) appeared
again, and led them on to the couch of the infant Messiah.
At the extremity of this plain, and on a height
commanding a view both of Jerusalem and Bethlehem,
is the Greek monastery of Elijah, where is one of the
sacred places of the country. “Here,” says el Devoto
Peregrino, “is a rock impressed by the body of the
holy prophet, as natural as if it had been stamped
there; for we see the head, the shoulders, the ribs
and body, extended horizontally. This is the place
to which the holy prophet retired to contemplate the
future Messiah; and where, looking towards Bethlehem,
he saw him enveloped in coarse swaddling clothes,
but surrounded by angels, singing glory to God in the
highest; and, looking towards Jerusalem, saw him
nailed to the cross and crowned with thorns, while
the multitude around were blaspheming and insulting
him.”</p>

<p>Sandys, in his quaint style, remarks of it: “Hard
by is a flat rock, whereon they told us that the
prophet was accustomed to sleepe, and that it beares
as yet the impression of his body. Indeed, there are
certaine hollowes in the same, but not by mine eyes
apprehended to retaine any manly proportions.”</p>

<p>I speak of the place from the authority of others,
for I felt no disposition at the time to trouble myself
with matters of this nature. Indeed, it requires a
constant effort in travellers among these places to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
keep the mind free from disgust, and from the baneful
effects of the errors, that, like leeches, have fastened
themselves to the truth, covering and deforming
it, and exhausting its power, while they themselves
live on its fading strength.</p>

<p>The monastery is surrounded by a strong wall,
and looks as if it might be a place adapted as much
for defence as for devotion.</p>

<p>Bethlehem here came into full view, though more
than two miles distant; the country between it and us,
although broken, being rather low, and the town itself
being situated on an eminence of steep ascent. On the
way, we left, at a short distance on our right hand,
a small square edifice surmounted by a dome, evidently
a modern structure, but called the tomb of
Rachael, and regarded by Moslems as well as by the
Christian sects here with high respect. Further on
to our left, and below the town of Bethlehem, was
a small valley, covered even at this hot season
with a refreshing verdure; and here they inform us
the shepherds were watching their flocks by night,
when the angel appeared to announce glad tidings
of great joy, the birth of “a Saviour, which is Christ
the Lord.” Near this is also a well, said to be the
one from which David’s three “mighty men” procured
him water at the risk of their lives. Passing
these spots, we soon after arrived at the outskirts of
Bethlehem; and as our large cavalcade wound up
the steep ascent, the whole population of the place
came crowding along the way, hanging over the rude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
walls, and filling every door and window. They are all
Christians in name, though they bear an indifferent
character; and, what in these countries strikes one
with surprise, the women appeared with their faces
exposed, and frequently very good-looking faces they
were. Our arrival seemed to excite a very unusual
sensation, which I was able to account for by and
by, when one of the men, taking me aside in the
convent, asked seriously whether the report was true,
“that we had come to take the place from the Egyptian
Pasha.” They bear no good feeling towards
the Moslem power, and have always been refractory
and troublesome subjects to the Porte; their insulated
situation, and the facilities for retiring to mountain
fastnesses in the wild country around, encouraging in
them bold and independent habits. We were informed
that when the general order from Mohammed
Ali for disarming the populace of Syria was carried
to them, they sent in about a dozen muskets, saying,
that these were all they had; nor could any threats
wrest more from them, though the place has three or
four hundred fighting men well equipped. The town
is situated on a piece of isolated table land, of sudden
elevation on every side. On the east this runs out
into a narrow tongue, and at the extremity of this
projection, 200 yards distant from the village, are the
monastery and church of the Franciscans, covering
the spot where the Messiah was born.</p>

<p>The recent earthquake had rent the massive walls
of these edifices, but not so as to endanger them,
and we met with a ready and hospitable reception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
beneath the roof. The door of entrance is low and
strong, and every where in this country is the
traveller reminded of the insecurity of life and property;
and, unless people would live there with a
martyr’s spirit, of the necessity of being constantly
prepared for defence.</p>

<p>Having entered the building, we were carried
along some winding passages, and found ourselves
presently in a church that had once been splendid,
but which is now in a dilapidated state, owing
partly to the effects of time, and partly to the spoliations
of the Turks. It has four rows of columns,
ten in each row, and still imposing objects, the effect
of which is heightened by gilding and paintings on
the wall; but the colors are dim, and the pavement
is torn up, and the place has a melancholy grandeur
that chills and oppresses the feelings.</p>

<p>They took us from this, after a short period for
resting, into some side passages, and we soon found
ourselves descending into the Cave of the Nativity.
It is reached at one end by a tortuous underground
passage, but on the other by a flight of steps that
brings us at once to the spot. We were introduced
by the former of these, and after winding along for
a distance of about fifty feet, we turned short to the
left, and a flood of light bursting suddenly upon us,
we knew that we were in the Chapel or Cave of the
Nativity. The main body of this subterranean
apartment is about thirty-five feet long by twelve in
width, with a height of ten or twelve feet, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
irregular in shape. On either side, as we advanced,
were benches or seats for those who may choose to
come here for meditation. Having proceeded about
twenty feet, we came to a small apartment on our
right, about ten feet square, the floor of which is
lower by eighteen inches than the remainder of the
cave; it is open in front, where are two pillars to
support the roof. On the three remaining sides are
shallow recesses; one of which, they inform us, is
the manger in which the infant Messiah was laid;
in the recess opposite the Magi sat, and in the third
they deposited the gifts of “gold, frankincense, and
myrrh.” The rock over this apartment is bare, and
visitors are allowed to break off small fragments;
the other portions of the cave are all lined with precious
marbles.</p>

<p>Just beyond this spot the cave branches to the
right and left, a broad flight of steps, on either hand,
leading, at the distance of about twenty feet, to the
surface of the ground; at the angle formed by this
branching is another recess, about three feet deep
and six in length. It is occupied by an altar, over
which is a handsome painting of the Adoration;
the altar is in form of a table, and beneath it, at the
centre of a star formed of marble mosaic work, is a
silver plate inscribed,</p>

<p class="center">HIC DE VIRGINE MARIA JESUS CHRISTUS NATUS
EST.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Here Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary.</em></p>

<p>I suppose there can be no reasonable doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
this is actually the cave of the Nativity. Hadrian,
in derision of the Christians, placed here a statue of
Adonis, and Helena, not long after, erected the church,
the remains of which we have just been examining.
Jerome speaks of the place as undisputed in his
day; and as he resided here a while, we must suppose
him well acquainted with the subject. A subterranean
chamber, on the right of the winding passage
by which we had reached this cave, is still
pointed out as his study; they show, adjoining to it,
also, the place where the bodies of the Innocents
were cast, the sepulchre of St. Jerome, that of
Eusebius, and that also of St. Paula and her
daughter Eustoquio, persons distinguished in the
Romish calendar. Over the small chamber in
which the manger is situated, they show also what
they call a picture of St. Jerome, stained miraculously
in the natural rock.</p>

<p>It is sad, when we enter a place of such powerful
interest, to be met at the very threshold with things
that we cannot believe; and instead of being left to
indulge in salutary reflections, to be compelled to
commence separating truth from error, and fixing
their boundaries, or else to feel the repulsive and
chilling effect of scepticism settling upon the whole.
The great error of the Romish and Greek churches
here has been in endeavoring to fix upon a locality
for every event noticed in Scripture; and even the
parables of our Saviour have not been suffered to
escape from this spirit of blind and injudicious zeal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
They point out upon the Mount of Olives spots as
those where the Saviour taught the Lord’s Prayer,
where the Apostles composed the creed, where
Christ wept over Jerusalem, where he preached the
Judgment, &amp;c.; and on Mount Zion, where the
last supper was held, where Peter retired to weep,
where Isaiah was sawn in two, and a great variety
of other places with which it is not necessary to
fatigue the reader.</p>

<p>And as if this were not enough, they have got up
traditions of the wildest and most startling nature,
and the whole country is full of the localities with
which these are connected. On the way out to
Bethlehem are two which I have not yet noticed,
and at which I will now barely glance. One is a
place where formerly stood a turpentine tree. As
the Virgin was going to Jerusalem with the infant
for the Presentation in the Temple, this tree bowed
and did reverence as they passed; and to make its
show of respect more lasting, did not return to its
former position, but remained thus inclined. It was
worthy of observation, too, that ever after, though
the air might be sultry and stifling in all the region
about it, yet under this tree was always a refreshing
breeze. Indulgences were granted to those
who recited prayers beneath it; wood was cut from
it by night (through fear of the Turks), and carried,
in the form of crosses, all over Europe. The Arabs,
at length, in a fit of ill humor, cut it down.</p>

<p>As we descend the hill toward Bethlehem is another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
spot made sacred by their traditions. The
Virgin passing by this place, saw a man sowing or
planting beans, and asking him what he was employed
at, received for answer that he was sowing pebbles;
on which, the beans in his basket turned to
pebbles, nor has any care since that availed to make
the field produce any thing else than stones.</p>

<p>These are only specimens of the superstitious legends
with which the whole region is filled.</p>

<p>On our return to the convent, we found an excellent
dinner in a state of preparation by the monks,
who indeed, during the whole of our visit, treated
us with great hospitality and attention; on leaving it,
we, in return, made them a present of some gold coin,
which, as was perfectly proper, they accepted. During
the recent troubles in the country, the strong
walls of their monastery had afforded protection to
the persons and property of many of the inhabitants
of Bethlehem; and we found several of the chambers
and passages still filled with furniture and bags of
grain. While dinner was in preparation, the natives
of the town crowded in with a great variety of
articles which they are in the habit of making for
pilgrims; crosses, inkstands, boxes of mother of pearl,
huge clasps for girdles made of a complete shell
with figures cut in relief, and beads of the same material,
and of a substance called Mecca-stone, which
is sometimes colored red or black. Most of these objects
were rude enough, but some of the figures in relief
were conceived and executed in a manner that would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
not have disgraced an Italian artist. The pilgrims
place these things first in the Cave of the Nativity,
and then carry them to the Holy Sepulchre, where,
being deposited on the tomb, prayers are said over
them, which are supposed to give them a supernatural
power over evil spirits, so far as to protect the
persons and property of the possessors.</p>

<p>While most of us were laying in large stores of
their bead and pearl manufactures, some of our
younger companions were submitting to the painful
process of having figures, from Scriptural subjects,
pricked and stained in the arm with blue or black
pigment, a species of tattooing, at which, it seems,
the Bethlehemites are expert, and to which pilgrims
very often submit. It is not often that they have
such a market for their commodities, and I believe
our visit to Bethlehem will long be remembered; to
us it was certainly a very interesting epoch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Taking our usual interpreter, an intelligent young
Armenian, for a guide, and accompanied, whether
we would or no, by a half crazy and yet very shrewd
fellow, called Yaoub, a party of us made an excursion
one day to “the Tombs of the Kings.” They lie
about three quarters of a mile north of the city, amid
olive groves and fields; and we found the walk there
pleasanter than we anticipated.</p>

<p>We passed out by the Damascus gate, so called
from the circumstance that the great road from Damascus
enters the city here; and soon after leaving
it, turned to our right to examine a huge cavern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
that stood yawning upon us. It is called the Cave
of Jeremiah, from a tradition that he made it his residence;
it is above 100 feet deep, by seventy in
width and thirty in height, and is a gloomy, desolate
place, such as we may suppose would have
been chosen by the author of the Lamentations; but
I presume there is no other authority for its name.</p>

<p>We were now on the hill Bezetha, where stood
the Neopolis, or New City, inclosed by Agrippa’s
wall. The hill is still marked with tolerable distinctness,
though it is in no place very high. It is ridge
shaped, declining gently towards the east and west,
and ascending gradually towards the north. Passing
on, we reached, in a short time, a square pit with
smooth perpendicular sides, about 100 feet on each
side and fifteen in depth, cut in the solid rock, and resembling
a quarry, which it may have originally been.
An inclined plane at the north-eastern angle leads
to the bottom; and having descended by this, we had
opposite to us, on the south, a portico about twenty-five
feet long by ten in depth, cut out of the solid rock;
this is surmounted by an entablature, enriched with
flowing sculpture of plants and fruits, in bold relief,
and of very superior execution. At the eastern end of
this portico was a hole, formerly a door-way of easy
passage, but now so filled up that we could enter only
by prostrating ourselves flat on the ground, and
pushing ourselves forward by the feet. Having entered
in this manner, we found that we were in a
room about twenty feet square, cut entirely out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the solid rock. It appears to have served as a vestibule
to other chambers, of which there are six in
number, each with one or more receptacles for the
dead. These consist of troughs cut out of the native
rock, not sunk in the floor as is generally the case in
the ancient sepulchres about this city, but on its
level; fragments of the covers of one or two were
scattered about the rooms; these were enriched with
flowing sculpture, very well executed in strong relief;
the coffins or sarcophagi were in other respects entirely
plain.</p>

<p>The doors by which these chambers were closed
are very remarkable objects. They are of stone, and
are in dimensions about forty by thirty inches, and
are six inches in thickness. Above and below are
projecting knobs, forming a portion of the same stone,
four inches in length; these were inserted into corresponding
sockets, and formed the pivots on which
the door revolved; but the question, how they were
inserted into the grooves, is one that it would be difficult
to solve. It is said that the ancients had a mode
of fastening these doors so that no one who had not
the secret could open them without breaking the
stone. I have seen similar grooves in the gateway
of the citadel of Mycenæ in Greece; and the sculpture
belonging to these tombs, so strongly resembling
the Grecian, appears to indicate for them an origin in
the latter days of the ancient city. They are probably
what by Josephus are called Herod’s Monument,
and in another place, “the sepulchral caverns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
of the Kings;”<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and I think we may reasonably suppose
them to have been formed by Herod. If this
surmise with regard to their name is correct, they receive
an additional interest, as showing us the
northern boundary of the “new city” of Bezetha.</p>

<p>From this we proceeded to visit “the Tombs
of the Judges,” which lie nearly a mile further, in a
course somewhat west of north. The ground was
still cultivated in patches, and was covered with
olive trees; the surface undulating. We passed, on
the way, several subterranean apartments like that
which Dr. Clarke discovered on the Mount of
Olives, and which he supposed to have been a
chapel for the secret and forbidden worship of the
false gods. They are in shape like a bee-hive, are
plaistered, and are entered by a small hole at
the apex, which is the only opening. To our judgment
they seemed designed to be reservoirs for water,
or for granaries, but were most probably the
former. Several years since I discovered one
exactly similar to these, on some heights overlooking
the site of the ancient Abydos at the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>We were now getting into an interesting region,
evidently that from which were procured the huge
blocks that formed the walls of the ancient city.
The rock here is compact and solid, and of a fine
texture; and for a great distance, and in every direction,
exhibited the appearance that rocks would do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
from which large rectangular blocks with smooth
surfaces had been cut. The vertical sections were
regular and smooth, and sometimes fifteen or twenty
feet in height. In the face of them were a great number
of tombs, such as I have already described; sometimes
consisting of a single chamber, sometimes of a
succession of chambers, and with from two to four
burial-places each, generally without ornament, and,
as far as we observed, without inscriptions.</p>

<p>The largest of these chambers are called the
Tombs of the Judges; but as the name is probably
fanciful, we gave it little attention. Nor are the
tombs themselves, except in size, more interesting
than the others. These tombs are scattered over a
surface of about a square mile, and are numerous.</p>

<p>In the interval between this and the city grows
abundantly a thorn, which is considered to be the
species from which the Saviour’s crown of thorns
was made. It is called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhamnus Paliurus</i>, and
consists of a bush with long slender twigs, on which
are, alternately, a long and a short thorn, slightly
curved and very sharp. It is found all over Syria,
and also in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>We set out from this on our return; but the sun
had set, and when we reached the city gates we
found them closed; nor, in the strict vigilance
which the recent dangers had taught them, was it
at that time easy to get them opened again. Our
crazy friend, Yaoub, who had been acting the merry-andrew
along the road, now, however, interfered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and was more serviceable than a more sensible person
would have been. He hailed a soldier, whom,
in his walks about, he spied reconnoitring us
through a loop-hole, and the man of gunpowder
and bullets, perhaps thinking him sufficiently crazy
to be a Turkish Santon or Saint, was at length
brought to a parley. A messenger was despatched
forthwith to the Governor; and Yaoub, now once
more quite at ease, called to the soldiers to pass him
a pipe beneath the gate, which having been done, he
sat down to enjoy its fumes and his own importance.
The messenger at length returned, and the guard
having been mustered, and the gates having been
thrown wide open, we were about to advance, when
we were met by a couple of dozen fixed bayonets
directly at our breast. We were brought to a stand
till a more careful scrutiny of our faces had satisfied
the officers that we were not wild Arabs in disguise;
when the ranks opened, and we were allowed to
enter. And we found that the prospect of spending
the night in the open fields, that for a while was
staring upon us, was sufficient to give a charm even
to our hard and uneasy quarters in the convent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Departure of the first party. Mohammed Ali’s firman, and alarm
of the Governor. Sickness of Mr. M. and Mr. Nicholayson.
Trials of Missionaries. Their general character and qualifications.
Moonlight view of Jerusalem, and reflections. Arrival
of the second party. Interview with the Governor. Visit to Bethany.
Departure from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Our party, with a good store of relics, olive canes
from the Mount of Olives, and other memorials of
their visit, left Jerusalem on the morning of the
20th; their early departure being occasioned by a
desire to give the officers, who had remained in
charge of the ships, also an opportunity of visiting
the city.</p>

<p>While we were preparing to sail from Alexandria,
the Egyptian monarch had ordered to be prepared
for Commodore Patterson a letter of introduction to
Ibrahim Pasha, and a firman for all Syria, worded
in strong terms of kindness, commanding all persons,
whether in authority or otherwise, to treat him, and
those with him, with the same respect and attention
that they would show personally to Mohammed Ali
himself. The Commodore, during his stay in Jerusalem,
had made an official call on the Governor,
but not finding him at home, had made no use of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the firman. Just, however, as the party were preparing
to leave the city, the Governor heard of it,
probably through the Pasha of Jaffa, where it had
been used, and in great alarm sent immediately to
apologize for not having shown the party greater
attentions. When they reached the gate this morning,
they found on the outside a double file of soldiers,
who presented arms, and the Governor himself
here joined the Commodore, and accompanied
him some distance from the city. He regretted that
he had not had official notice of our coming, so that
he might have prepared accommodations for the
party; and said that when the second company
should arrive, they would find a commodious house
ready for them. We certainly, however, had no
cause of complaint; for we had every where
been treated with respect and kindness; and the
Governor’s offer of a large escort to the plain of
Jordan I have already noticed. The anecdote will
show the dread in which the Egyptian Pasha is
held through all his dominions.</p>

<p>I did not accompany the party back, having
received permission to remain till the second company
should conclude their visit. Mr. M., our sailing-master,
who was ill of a fever, and unable to
ride, was also left behind; and as the fever began
to increase rapidly upon him, we accepted Mr.
Nicholayson’s invitation, and had him placed in
more comfortable quarters at the Missionary house.
But Mr. Nicholayson was now himself becoming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
seriously ill. His health had been for some time
feeble; and recent exposure to the sun, and fatigue,
had brought on sickness. It was now evident that
a violent fever was burning in his veins. There
was no nurse in the house, and I removed also from
the convent to this hospital, for such Mr. N.’s dwelling
had now literally become.</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget the night that followed
these changes, a night of the deepest anxiety and
distress. In the lower part of the house was a
little girl, daughter of the Armenian patriarch of
Beirout, put here to board, sick with the ophthalmia;
two servants were also ill of fevers, and unable to
help themselves; Mrs. N. was just recovering from
a long sickness, and durst not expose herself to
fatigue. In one corner of the room with me was
Mr. M., restless, and in a burning heat, and on an
adjoining bed was stretched Mr. N., now in a high
fever, and quite delirious. For the others we could
find some medicines tolerably appropriate, but the
case of the last gentleman baffled our judgment,
and there was not a physician to be had in the
place. It was sad to be compelled to sit and listen
to his ravings, and to see the disease hourly taking
stronger hold upon him, and know not what to do.
The ruling passion of his life was still prevailing,
even in his wildest fancies; and his language was
about the mission and its friends, or else he was
disputing with the Jewish Rabbis, and quoting Hebrew
from their voluminous authors. Thus wore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the night away, a long and distressing night; and
the day brought no relief, for we had the grief to
see our friend sinking fast under his fiery disease.
The fever left him towards evening, but as weak as
an infant, and now particularly needing assistance
which we knew not how to give; for the disease
appeared to be of a complicated nature, and the little
medicine which we ventured to administer, had done
harm rather than good. If I could picture that
missionary family as I saw it there, the scene would,
I think, be a refutation of the charges of those who
seem to think that missionaries go abroad for selfish
and unworthy purposes. They had just passed
through times of alarm and distress, such as persons
seldom, and in our homes are never, called to
witness; a city for days rocked and shattered by
earthquakes, till the affrighted inhabitants knew not
where to fly, and then plundered by fierce and lawless
men. Their house had been pierced with cannon
balls, and they were compelled to fly from one
place to another for shelter; one of their company,
whose health had been too feeble for these rude
shocks, they had carried to the tomb, and had buried
her beside another martyr in the same cause of
missions.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In the house were now six invalids, some
very ill, and one, the head of the family, apparently
at the point of death; nor was there a physician to
be any where found.&mdash;And the grave which we
expected to dig for him was soon after this, dug for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
another of the mission family, Dr. Dodge, whom we
met on the way as we were returning to Jaffa. Yet
they keep their ground, undismayed by dangers and
death; suffering discomforts with cheerfulness; patient
amid rebuffs, and with a zeal that tries, even in
subjects of disappointment, to find new sources of
hope, and that “fainteth not, neither is weary.” Nine
months after this, as our ship was lying in Gibraltar
bay, I heard that Mrs. Nicholayson was on board an
English brig that, after suffering severely in a storm,
had just come in and anchored; and procuring a
boat, I went within speaking distance, for the brig
was in quarantine, and we were not permitted to
go on board. She was then taking her little children
to England for the purpose of putting them to school,
and among society less hurtful to youthful minds than
that of the east; and after thus leaving them, was to
return to her far distant and now childless home.
If in all this is not a picture of self-denial, and patient
endurance, and Christian boldness, and painful sacrifice,
I do not know what is; and yet it is only a
plain statement of facts. In our ships we are apt to
complain of discomforts; and yet we have plenty of
medicines, and good surgical attendance, food such
as we are accustomed to at home, and society and
abundance of comforts of every kind; and yet it
seems a hard case to be three years from home; and
I now speak of ships in particular, because their inmates
know what it is to be a long time from one’s
native land. But suppose it were for life; and a life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
separated from the comforts to which we have been
accustomed, shut out in a great measure from intelligent
society; a life of drudgery too, offering knowledge
to those who care not for it; simplifying its
nature, and bringing it to the capacities of all, and
yet exciting little interest, and perhaps a sneer? Is
this a life to be sought for, for the sake of worldly
considerations? I think not. There is only one
way in which we can reconcile it even with common
sense; and that is, by supposing that missionaries
are sincere; that they love their work; that the
promises of the gospel, and the cheering influences
of heavenly grace, support them; and that they look
to eternity for their exceeding great reward. And
when we look at them in this point of view, how
engaging is their work, and how Godlike the errand
on which they are gone? And it was a truly noble
act in that church which I now love doubly to call
my own&mdash;the Episcopal church,&mdash;when, at the last
General Convention, its clerical and lay deputies
from all parts of the country unanimously resolved
that the whole Episcopal church be hereafter a Missionary
Society; and declared that the cause of missions
is the cause of religion, and a love for missions
an essential part of the Christian character.</p>

<p>As regards the missionaries themselves, I do not
know any class of men that presents, as a body, a
more respectable array of talent or intelligence than
this; and if any one should be disposed to doubt
the fact, the proof is very easily to be found. He has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
only to take their reports to their several societies,
their letters and published addresses to the public,
and when he has read them, I will challenge him to
produce from any other class of men, productions so
uniformly correct in style, so free from puerilities,
and so abundant in useful facts and valuable sentiments.
In geography and statistics, in mineralogy,
in geology, and in various other matters of science,
they have furnished us with a mass of most valuable
information from all parts of the world; their observations
are minute, and generally very correct; and
if the world were to receive no other benefit than the
knowledge which their papers have scattered among
our community, it would be recompensed for the money
bestowed upon them. I do not wish to write their
panegyric, but to defend them from charges which I
have often heard brought against them; and the defence
is a simple statement of facts which are before
the public, and to which any man who chooses may
have access. As to the charge that the pictures they
give of their successes are over-wrought, I believe it
often to be just; and it is not strange that men who
have given their lives to one great subject, and are filled
with zeal and are in earnest about it, should sometimes
over-rate their influence, or, in the excitement of supposed
or real success, should draw a picture more
highly colored than a cooler observation of facts
would warrant. But this, I believe, is the extent of
their offending; they themselves appear to have
been taught by experience greater distrust and caution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
in these matters; and their recent accounts will
be found to be more stamped with prudence, and more
the result of cool and calm observation, than they
formerly were; while they show no diminution of interest
in their great work. I cannot help again earnestly
recommending their letters and reports home, and
repeating that these reports, coming from so large
a number of men, and so variously situated, are remarkable
for perspicuity of style, and for simplicity
and yet force of expression.</p>

<p>The night of the 21st passed away like the preceding
one, a long night, and one of great anxiety;
life seemed to be hanging by so brittle a thread, that
the least shock appeared capable of breaking it. I
stole now and then from the sick man’s couch, and
looked out upon the city, bathed in moonlight, and
hushed in the deepest repose. How quiet! how
tranquil! Could this be the Jerusalem where, in a
short time, 1,100,000 had perished amid the horrors
of war?</p>

<p>The view from my window took in the Mount of
Olives, the dark wall-like range beyond overhanging
the Dead Sea, the mosque of Omar, the church of
Mount Calvary, and a large portion of the city; and
offered subjects for solemn and useful contemplation.</p>

<p>Could we have the history of all nations written by
men to whom God had condescended to unfold the
reasons for his acts, would it&mdash;would it not&mdash;appear
like those of the Jews? Should we not find what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
we call man’s doings very often the doings of God;
and man only the agent, a free agent, and yet, by
the mysterious combination of His Omnipotence with
our freedom, man only an agent in working great
events; and those events acts of reward or of retribution
from Heaven on kingdoms for their observance
or neglect of His commandments?</p>

<p>Over yon mountain David passed, dethroned, expelled,
a fugitive from his own son; attended only
by a small train of attached but desponding friends.
If we knew not the cause of this, it might have
been passed as thousands of such acts pass in history,
leading us to as little useful reflection; but we are informed
why it was; and these thousand other acts in
history, are they not retributive too? And will not the
same apply to nations? And, could we see into
Heaven’s councils, should we not find what appears
to be the entangled web of national events all plain
and simple&mdash;a few simple and general rules, as in
the works of nature, pervading and governing the
whole? And would not the first of these be that the
fear of God and respect for his commandments are
the only source of national happiness and national
stability?</p>

<p>On that mountain Titus also stood, and formed
plans for the destruction of the ancient city. To
himself and to his Roman army the son of Vespasian
was there for his own purposes; but be this as it
may, <em>we</em> know that there were also other purposes to
be effected. In the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
though the application is complicated, yet a simple
principle stands at the head of it all; “If thou shalt
hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy
God, <em>to observe</em> and <em>to do</em> all his commandments,
blessed shalt thou be;” “if thou wilt not hearken
diligently to observe and to do, cursed shalt thou be;
and the Lord shall bring a nation against thee from
afar,” &amp;c. The passage is too long for quotation,
but I beg the reader to turn to it and read from the
49th to the 58th verses inclusive, and compare them
with Josephus’ account of the siege of Jerusalem; and
ask himself if the same rule does not probably apply
to us, and if we have not reason to “fear this glorious
and fearful name&mdash;THE LORD THY GOD.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About five o’clock on the following afternoon a
second party from our ship, consisting of about fifty
persons, arrived; and were met at the gate by an
officer from the Governor, who came to say that a
house had been provided, and was ready to receive
them. This was indeed doing things on a handsome
scale; and the party gladly accepting his hospitality,
were shown to a large edifice not far from
the entrance of the city, which, after sundry ablutions,
proved to be a very comfortable and convenient
lodging place. In the party was Doctor B., who
immediately came over to see Mr. Nicholayson, and
on examining, spoke very doubtfully of his case.
Tired, however as he was, he immediately offered his
services for the night; and he afterwards persevered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
in a course of most assiduous attentions, which,
doubtless, were the means of saving a valuable life.
When we left the city on the 25th, Mr. N. was yet
very weak, but convalescent; and, we were happy to
hear, afterwards entirely recovered. We were glad,
also, to be able to send the mission family, from the
ship, some wine and other comforts, which their circumstances
urgently required.</p>

<p>Captain Nicolson, who came with the second
party, took an early opportunity of calling, with
most of his officers, to pay his respects to the
Governor of Jerusalem. He resides in a large, but
by no means splendid house, near the centre of the
city; and on our arrival we were detained a short
time till the servants could get his women out of
the way. We found him a tall and fine-looking
man, with marks of old age creeping upon him;
which, however, did not seem to affect his gallantry
towards the ladies, as he told us that he had lately
added another wife to his household. The usual
compliment of pipes, sherbet, &amp;c., was paid; and
while the odoriferous fumes were ascending in
graceful curves, a rambling conversation was carried
on, sometimes about this country, and sometimes
about our own. The frank address of Captain
N. soon thawed the old gentleman’s gravity, and the
interview was more lively and full of humor than
is usual in a Turkish divan. The officers all took
part in the conversation, each with proper respect;
and the Governor seemed to be quite surprised at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the accounts we gave him of the extent and
resources of our country, the length of our rivers, and
our rapid growth as a nation. If we did not convince
him that America is the greatest country in
the world, I think we must at least have satisfied
him that we have a very high opinion of it ourselves.
He seemed to be amused and gratified, and we parted
right good friends.</p>

<p>During the stay of this party, I took Yaoub as guide
one day, and went out to make a visit to Bethany. It
lies on a pretty steep declivity on the eastern side of
the Mount of Olives, and I believe I have already
stated that there are two roads to it, one directly
across the mountain, and another, much less difficult,
winding around the southern extremity. By
the latter it is about three miles distant. There are
now only a few miserable houses remaining, together
with the ruins of a large and massive building,
which, they tell us, was the house of Lazarus. They
take the visitor also to a cave, in which, they say,
he was buried; but in all these assertions I have
little confidence.</p>

<p>The 25th was fixed upon for our departure, and
at two o’clock in the morning our cavalcade was
formed without the gates, and we began to move forward
towards the ship. As we passed on, I turned
often to take another look at the city, whose white
domes and minarets were still visible above the serrated
walls, and were now shining with silvery lustre
in the quiet moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Farewell then, Jerusalem, city of marvels;
wonderful, awful, enthroned in the hearts of men,
making a part of the very soul and life-blood of thy
people. City of God! when shalt thou revive again?
Terrible has been thy fall; wo upon wo was poured
out upon thee; thou art stricken to the dust; and
yet in thy humiliation, in the very depths of abasement,
thou still art great! Thou drawest to
thee pilgrims of three religions, whose empires stretch
east and west till they meet again in the opposite
confines of our globe; they come to thee to worship,
they come to thee to die! In lands far distant
and of recent birth, we are taught to lisp thy name
in our childhood; thy scenes and thy history mingle
in our earliest dreams; and in the moments
when we most need comfort, our thoughts turn
towards thee!</p>

<p>Mount Calvary! the atmosphere does not more
closely invest our globe, and enter into and support
our systems, than does the comfort that flows from
thy bloody cross encircle, and penetrate, and support
our souls. Without it we gasp and perish.
Mysterious! that to such a bloody scene we should
have to resort for consolation. Wonderful religion,
that teaches us that by the deep and awful humiliation
of God we are elevated to glory; and, after leading
us amid creation, and showing us that He is wise
and powerful, takes us here and at the foot of the
cross shows that He is also of boundless goodness.</p>

<p>Saviour, who hast ransomed us, be thou enthroned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
in our hearts! We descend the winding pathway,
and the city of our redemption is shut from our
sight: help us to enter the New Jerusalem, and to
come to that Zion where is everlasting gladness,
and from which sorrow and sighing for ever flee
away!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Accident on our return. Visit to St. Jean D’Acre. Also to Tyre.
Prophecies respecting Tyre fulfilled. Visit to Sidon. Lady
Hester Stanhope. Her letter of invitation to us. Visit to her
residence at D’joun Beirout. Missionary families at Beirout.
Striking feature in the Protestant Missionary operations. Their
schools and printing presses.</p>

<p>An accident, by which one of our party was
seriously hurt, on our way back, damped the gratification
of our visit and retarded our progress; but
having left the invalid officer and Dr. B. at Ramla,
we were able to reach the ship in good season the
same evening. Some seamen were despatched during
the night with a litter; and having thus got
our companions on board, we weighed anchor on
the afternoon of the 26th, and with a light breeze
stood northwardly along the coast.</p>

<p>As we passed Cæsarea, about thirty-five miles distant
from Jaffa, our glasses enabled us to distinguish
a few masses of masonry, which is all that remains of
that once large and magnificent city. A few hours
after this we came opposite to the northern termination
of Mount Carmel, on the summit of which the
monastery of Elijah<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> was a very conspicuous object.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
The French ensign was flying on the top of it, probably
in answer to our colors. The mountain was
green, and had an agreeable appearance; it thrusts
itself some distance into the sea, and forms the
southern extremity of a large bay, at the northern
end of which is St. Jean D’Acre, the ancient
Ptolemais.</p>

<p>We dropped our anchor a few miles from this latter
city on the evening of the 27th, and some boats,
with parties, were despatched to the shore. I have
seen no place exhibit so strikingly the ruthless and destructive
character of war as did this city at the time
of our visit. It was at this place that Mohammed Ali
first began to put in execution his ambitious designs
upon Syria. Under pretence of assisting the Sultan
in putting down a refractory Pasha, he brought his
army and navy against the place; but met what
Bonaparte had here met before him, a fierce and
determined resistance. It was subjected to a long
bombardment, and at length, on the last of May,
1832, was taken by assault, when his soldiers are
said to have been guilty of the greatest excesses.</p>

<p>The city is built upon a point of land running
into the sea, and is surrounded by strong walls;
those on the land side being assisted by ditches and
by other lines of defence.</p>

<p>Scarcely a house was any where to be seen that
had not suffered from the shot. We were particularly
struck with a very high wall, the remains of
some important edifice, that was completely riddled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and now stood between us and the setting sun,
which was pouring a stream of light through every
crevice, and making the ruin look still more desolate.
We made the circuit of the walls, and walked
through the city, but did not see more than thirty
inhabitants in the whole place.</p>

<p>Leaving our anchorage early the next morning,
we glided up towards Tyre, which lies about thirty
miles distant from St. Jean D’Acre, being separated
from it by a strip of low but sufficiently fertile land,
beyond which the mountains of Samaria commence.
Our visit to this country had put our Bibles in more
than usual requisition; and I had been pointing out
to some friends the prophecies concerning Tyre,
and comparing these with the accounts given by
travellers of the utter desolation of the place, had
endeavored to strengthen the argument for the Scriptures.
The spot is spoken of by Shaw as utterly
abandoned, except “by a few poor wretches, harboring
themselves in the vaults, and subsisting chiefly
upon fishing, who seem to be preserved in this place
by Divine Providence, as a visible argument how
God hath fulfilled his word concerning Tyre.”
Volney speaks of it as reduced to a miserable village,
consisting of “fifty or sixty wretched huts,
ready to crumble into ruins;” and Joliffe, a more
recent traveller, says, that “some miserable cabins,
ranged in irregular lines, dignified with the name
of streets, and a few buildings of a rather better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
description, occupied by the officers of government,
compose nearly the whole of the town.”</p>

<p>Approaching it with these impressions, I was surprised
to see a walled town of tolerable dimensions,
and with houses no worse looking than is ordinary
in these countries, above which, in answer to our ensign,
were waving the flags of most of the European
nations, together with our own star-spangled banner.
The ship was hove to, and we were thus enabled to
make a hasty visit to the place. Our boats passed
some ruins, probably remains of the times of the
Crusaders, which help to guard the harbor from the
wind and the sands. This looks as if it had once
been spacious, but it was now so choked up with
ruins of various kinds and with sand, as scarcely
to admit even our boats.</p>

<p>Our consul, accompanied by some of the representatives
of other nations, met us at the landing, and
conducted us to his house, where we were welcomed
with the usual forms of eastern hospitality. The
present population of Tyre, or <em>Tsour</em> as it is called
by the natives, I should judge to be about 3,000 persons;
it occupies about half of the ancient island,
which since the time of Alexander has been a peninsula.
It is surrounded by a wall of no great strength,
nor at present of any great utility, as the sands on
the eastern side, after covering over the isthmus to a
considerable depth, have reached the city and have
been <a id="Ref_311" href="#RRef_311">filled</a> up nearly to the height of its battlements.
The sand is the only enemy, therefore, from which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
fortifications are protecting them, for any other would
only have to walk up this inclined plane and let
themselves down into the city.</p>

<p>In a corner of the wall, about the centre of the
island, they showed us a large ruin, probably of a
church belonging to the times of the Crusaders, who
had possession of the place from the year 1124 to
1289. Near these ruins were some very large
columns of Egyptian granite, which looked as if
they might have been taken from some of the ancient
temples.</p>

<p>I passed out of the gate, and made the circuit of
the peninsula. The shore on the southern side is
formed of masses of bare rock, much eaten by the waves,
and in some places undermined. The foundations
of buildings are to be traced all over the ground, and
also extending out some distance into the sea. The
isthmus has become very wide, and now presents
nothing but hills of loose sand, driven about by every
wind, and destined perhaps to cover the entire peninsula.
The shore opposite, for an extent of miles,
is now also nothing but a bed of sand, amid which,
any traces of the ancient city that may have been
left by Alexander, have entirely disappeared. It
was of this old city, of sixteen miles in circumference,
and whose walls were 120 feet in height, that the
prophecy was uttered: “I will make thee a terror and
thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for,
yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord
God. All they that feared thee among the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
shall be astonished at thee; thou shalt be a terror,
and never shalt thou be any more;” and in vain
amid that plain of yellow drifting sand should
we seek for any memorial of it, or expect to see it
rise again. Of this great mistress of the sea, the
mother of many colonies, some, as for instance
Carthage, of prodigious wealth; of the city that distributed
crowns, “whose merchants were princes,
and whose traffickers were the honorable of the
earth,” nought now remains, and its site would probably
be unknown but for this island and the village
that stands here, as if in mockery of the greatness of
ancient Tyre. “Is this your joyous city, whose
antiquity is of ancient days?”</p>

<p>After walking about a short time among the dull
streets, we were glad to escape and get back to the
ship. The commerce of Tyre now consists of tobacco,
charcoal, and fagots;&mdash;what a contrast to
former times!</p>

<p>A gentle breeze wafted us on towards Sidon,
which being only fifteen miles distant, was soon
distinctly in view; the bold and towering chain of
Mount Lebanon forming a striking background to
the picture. This mountain commences just above
Tyre, and the greatness of that city in ancient times,
was probably owing, in some measure, to the outlet
afforded between the southern end of Lebanon and
the mountains of Samaria, to the trade from the great
plain of Damascus and the cities east of it. Sidon,
called by the natives <em>Seyd</em>, is also a walled town,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and is larger than Tyre, containing a population of
about 8,000 persons; but its harbor is most wretched,
and our boats were near being swamped in endeavoring
to get in. A boat from the shore hastened
out to assist us, as soon as they found we desired to
land; and placing itself before the Commodore’s
barge, guided us along the shallow and tortuous
channel, alongside of which a heavy surf was rolling
and breaking, and covering the water with foam.</p>

<p>After all we were poorly rewarded for our pains,
unless it may be something to say that we have been
at Sidon; for it is a poor miserable place. We desired,
on entering the city, to be taken to whatever
objects there might be of interest; and they immediately
started off with us for “the gardens;” the concourse
gathering fresh numbers as we advanced.
So we proceeded out of the town, and up a hill, and
then down; and there were the gardens, naked earth
planted with mulberry trees and vegetables; a spot
that would have delighted B&mdash;&mdash;, our steward, had
he been with us, but was not exactly to our present
taste. I ought to do the place justice, however; for
it appeared to be extremely fertile, and as far as our
eye could reach down the side of the eminence,
there was the deepest verdure, and a refreshing luxuriance
of foliage. We returned to the town as soon
as possible, as the sun was getting low, and walked
around and through it, but without finding a single
object worthy of note. The houses are generally
low and mean looking, and it appears to be a place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of few manufactures, and of little trade. Its rich and
beautiful back country, however, gives it a decided
preference over Tsour; and its population, I thought,
looked as if they might be more comfortable. We
have a consular agent here, also, whose kind offers
of hospitality the shortness of our time compelled
us to decline. On returning to the ship we filled
away and stood for the city of Beirout, which lies
about twenty miles to the northward of Sidon.</p>

<p>It had been our intention to call upon the celebrated
Lady Hester Stanhope, who we were informed
was living at Manlius, about four miles back of
Sidon; but learning that she had changed her residence
to D’joun, three miles further in the interior,
we were forced by the lateness of the hour to relinquish
our purpose. We met, however, at the consul’s,
a person who had been connected with her
household, and the Commodore requested him to inform
her ladyship that we had landed with the wish
to pay our respects to her, but had been prevented
by the distance and want of time. Soon after our
arrival at Beirout we received a very handsome and
polite invitation to make her a visit; and as I find
that she has excited considerable interest in our country,
I will give the letter as the best mode of presenting
her to the reader.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the American Admiral, Officers, and Ladies, who did me the
honor to inquire after me.</p>

<p class="ir2"><span class="smcap">D’joun</span>, 31st Aug., 1834.</p>

<p>You all ought to know how much I love and respect the American
nation. If the individuals did not command by their merit these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
sentiments, I must naturally inherit them from my grandfather.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
I should be too happy to invite to D’joun the whole of the party; but
my premises will not admit of their being comfortable. My house
is in a dilapidated state. My thoughts, as well as my finances, for
these last three years, have been wholly dedicated to one object&mdash;that
of the relief of the unhappy persons, which the situation of the
country increases every day. The body of the house at this moment
can only contain me, very ill lodged; and all I have at my disposal,
is two pretty good rooms in a court, or rather a small garden, dedicated
to strangers alone, that might lodge pretty comfortably, the
Admiral and three other gentlemen. I could not well propose it to
ladies, being a place which, from its public situation, I never frequent.
But should the Admiral’s lady and her daughters wish to see
something of the surrounding country, I offer them Manlius, where,
however, there is only one room furnished. The house is only inhabited
by an old woman and a servant; but by bringing their travelling
beds and their cook, they might be more comfortable than in
any other house in the neighborhood. I can also furnish them with
a very civil old man, known to Mr. Guys, called Lewis Marson,
who can talk French, and who is very capable of attending to all
their little wants.</p>

<p>I send Mr. Bertrand with this letter, that he may further explain
about the houses, or answer any other questions relative to them,
and to bring me your decision upon the subject.</p>

<p class="center">I very cordially salute you all.</p></div>

<p>Accordingly, after our return from Damascus, a party
was formed and spent four or five hours with her at
her residence at D’joun. The house is tolerably capacious,
and is situated in a large garden, laid out after the
English style, but the premises are somewhat out of repair.
I fear she finds ungrateful subjects among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
natives whom she has patronized, and among whom
she has spent a large part of her fortune. A few
years since she sent for our excellent consul at
Beirout, Mr. Chassaud, a gentleman of great integrity
of character and of business tact, and entreated
him to save her from the rapacity of the people
around her, who, by exorbitant demands, and by
various kinds of roguery, were rapidly reducing her
finances. He went and saved her fortune from a
complete wreck, and I believe, has now a high place
in her confidence.</p>

<p>She is a very extraordinary woman. Her person
is tall and commanding, and is shown by her costume,
the Turkish trowsers and vest and turban, to
the best advantage; she is still handsome, and appears
to take pleasure in showing her arm, which is
remarkably well turned and beautiful. Coffee, pipes,
&amp;c. were brought in, and while she encircled herself
with the aromatic fumes, she conversed on various
topics&mdash;politics, literature, manners, and religion.
She appeared to have a good knowledge of our
country, and the intelligence she displayed about the
politics of Europe was extraordinary for a person
shut out as she is from society, and seldom getting
even a newspaper. On most subjects she showed
excellent sense, and a strength of judgment seldom
witnessed in either of the sexes; but when religion
was broached she became instantly changed, and
was as wild as a maniac, both in language and to
some degree also in manner. She believes in magic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and astrology, and also that the Messiah will shortly
appear, and has in her stables a horse, with a natural
sinking or indentation in the back like a saddle, on
which she says he is to ascend up into heaven. She
formerly allowed visitors to see this animal, but has
for some years kept it more secluded; and though
the party on this occasion threw out hints as far as
politeness would allow them, they were not successful.</p>

<p>She was, it is said, a great favorite with her uncle
William Pitt, for whose society the acute and masculine
character of her mind well qualified her. Soon
after his death she suddenly resolved upon withdrawing
to this country, and sailed in a short time,
taking a large part of her fortune with her in the
vessel. She was wrecked near the island of Rhodes,
and her treasures were lost; but she was not to be
driven from her purpose; she returned immediately
to England, gathered together some more funds, and
again set sail for the east, where she has ever since
resided. At first she led a somewhat wandering
life; and at one time had unbounded influence over
the Arabs of the desert; but for some years she has
been residing at Manlius and D’joun; and with the
diminution of her funds has been also a decrease of
her power. I understand that lately, even her life
has sometimes been in danger.</p>

<p>It is probable that her mind, originally strong
though given to eccentric flights, in these wild retreats
where she has been shut out from intelligent
society, has turned and preyed upon itself, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
a species of derangement has been the consequence.
With her commanding form, her intelligent and
somewhat masculine face, her fanciful costume, and
the bright unearthly sparkling of her eye, she would
make a fine subject for a picture of an ancient Sibyl.</p>

<p>On the 29th we dropped our anchor at Beirout,
not opposite to the city, but in a large bay some
miles to the northward, where were afforded conveniences
for procuring water, of which our ship
was in need. Opposite to our anchorage are some
rocks at the foot of Lebanon, with a bold perpendicular
front, on which are cut some inscriptions in
ancient characters, probably Phœnician; and near
this is a cave, said to be the one where St. George of
merry England met and killed the dragon. The
fancy of the reader is fired at the mention of this;
and he is now most truly in the region of poetry;
for more poetical objects than this mountain of Lebanon,
with its wild glens, its rich valleys, its precipices,
and even its inhabitants also, are very seldom
to be seen.</p>

<p>Beirout is situated on the outer edge of a strip of
comparatively flat land about four miles across,
which commences at this place, and goes tapering off
to the southward, until it terminates somewhere not
far from Sidon. A large part of this plain, and every
accessible spot on the mountain, is under cultivation;
and as Beirout is also at present the seaport of
Damascus, it is a city of some consequence, and, for
this country, of considerable trade. It contains about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
eight thousand inhabitants, and on the land side is
walled; the harbor will admit only small vessels, but
a seventy-four may find safe anchorage in the road-stead,
as near almost to the shore as it may choose
to come. The country produces great quantities of
silk which is worked up in the city; and here, particularly,
are manufactured the fanciful variegated
scarfs used all over this region for sashes, and sometimes
for turbans.</p>

<p>In addition to the pleasures we received in the
family of our excellent consul, Mr. Chassaud, another
gratification awaited us here, in the society of three
of our countrymen, and their ladies, the Rev. Messrs.
Bird, Smith, and Whiting, missionaries, who have
been several years in the east, and during the last
five or six at Beirout. They speak the languages of
the natives with great fluency; and are men of intelligence
and talents sufficient to give them a high
standing in any society, no matter where. They
came on board immediately to welcome us, and
readily proffered such hospitality as their circumstances
would allow; their residence at that time
being on the mountain, for the sake of the superior
salubrity of its atmosphere in summer. Strangers
residing below in the hot season are subject to fevers,
and in the summer following that of our visit, they
had to lament the death of Dr. Dodge, a physician
connected with this mission and that at Jerusalem.
They have schools in the villages of the mountains,
and in Beirout; and at the time of our visit, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
making arrangements for a printing press which has
since arrived, and with which they are commencing
operations.</p>

<p>It must strike every one, even those opposed to
missions, as a pleasing circumstance, that in all such
establishments belonging to our country, the communication
of knowledge, not only in religious matters,
but on all topics, is one of the earliest and is ever
a constant object. Religion that comes thus associated
cannot wish to hood-wink or lead the people
blindfolded. It enlarges the mind, it teaches the
people to think, and gives them useful objects of history
and science to think about; it strengthens the
judgment; and to this judgment, thus strengthened
and thus rendered acute, it now appeals and asks for
admission to the heart. No man need be afraid of a
religion that comes in such companionship. It gives
us the very best proof possible that it considers itself
based on reason, and that it will bear the test of
scrutiny from enlightened and intelligent minds&mdash;which
scrutiny it ever invites. There is no jargon
of the schools here, no throwing of dust into men’s
eyes, no trying to blunt the intellect that nonsense may
be forced upon it. The missionaries come with geographies,
and arithmetics, and apparatus for easy and
simple lectures, and compendious histories; or where
such books are not to be had in the language, they
go to work immediately and translate them; and
they circulate them; and they gather the children
from the streets, and seek for the adults, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
teach them <em>knowledge</em>, not religious knowledge only
but knowledge of all kinds. Their object, if is
granted, is to introduce religion into the heart, <em>their</em>
religion, if the reader may choose to like the phrase;
but then it comes preceded by and associated with
<em>knowledge</em>; <em>it loves the light</em>; light is created, diffused,
and in this light it comes, and in it addresses
and appeals to us; and let him who opposes these
efforts, look and see if he does not oppose them because
he himself loves darkness rather than light,
and that because his own deeds are evil.</p>

<p>I visited a missionary house at Malta, belonging
to the English [Church?] Missionary Society, but
under the care of some gentlemen from Switzerland.
I found them striking off maps for an atlas in modern
Greek, and making Arabic globes to be sent to
Egypt, where, if I mistake not, it will astonish the natives
when they are told that the world is round, and
that they have been such prodigious travellers on its
surface, when they were thinking themselves all the
while sitting still. The shelves of this house were
also filled with a great variety of books, translations
of the most approved modern works for schools; and
these they were scattering around the Mediterranean
as fast as they were able. And when I went to the
dwelling house of one of them, (the only one married,)
I found his lady in a school with a room full
of children, many of whom had been common beggars
in the streets, and had been taken in here and
clothed; she was teaching them to read and sew,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and had a small cabinet filled with their work, each
article with the maker’s name&mdash;the money for which,
when sold, was to be delivered to the child itself.
Though their garments were often “of many colors,”
owing to the strange mixture of patches, yet there
was not one ragged child, and all were clean, and
they looked cheerful and happy.</p>

<p>And all this is only an example of the Protestant
missionary operations at Syra, and Athens, and Constantinople,
and Smyrna, and since they have got the
press, at Beirout, and in the islands of the Pacific,
and in India, and every where, wherever our missionaries
are to be found.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Party to Damascus. Ascent of Mount Lebanon. The roads.

A dilemma. First view of Damascus. The great plain.

<p>About noon on the first of September, a party of
us might have been seen winding along the streets
of Beirout, and then starting off in high spirits for
Damascus. That city is the present capital, and
residence of the Governor of Syria, and the Commodore
had determined, while the ship was taking
in water, to make it a visit.</p>

<p>Our company consisted of Commodore Patterson
and two daughters, nine officers, and about twelve
attendants and muleteers, and was headed by an
Armenian gentleman, Mr. Farrah, whom Mr.
Chassaud had just appointed American agent for
Damascus. Mr. Farrah was accompanied also by a
relative of his, so that we numbered altogether
twenty-six persons; a large cavalcade for visiting a
city where, only a year previously, it was extremely
hazardous for any one to be seen in the Frank dress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
so savage and bitter was the hatred of the inhabitants
towards all the Gaiours, or Christians. Mr.
Smith and his lady were also with us, intending to
accompany us as far as his house on the mountain,
where we were to stop for the night.</p>

<p>Our road, on leaving the city, laid across a small
plot of open ground bordered with trees, and immediately
after this entered a region of gardens and
vineyards, which appeared to be very productive.
Among them, on the right, is a substantial stone
house, recently erected by the missionaries for their
press and books. It had, in some respects, an
American look, and was an unexpected and welcome
sight. We kept ascending gently for about
two miles, when we came, at the summit of the
eminence, to a fine grove of large venerable looking
pines. The Pasha of Egypt is disposed to cultivate
this tree for the use of his navy, and not far off has
planted a little forest, which seems to be in a thriving
condition.</p>

<p>This spot commands a fine view of the mountain,
and plain, and sea, and is the one to which De La
Martine has given a pathetic interest. About three
miles beyond it we commenced the ascent of Mount
Lebanon, at first by a gently inclined plane, which,
however, did not continue long; soon we came
to steeper ascents, and then to yet steeper; and then
commenced a series of experiments in vaulting, flying,
and tumbling, which lasted quite across the
mountain, and were sometimes near costing us life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
or limb. I believe there was but one person in the
party who had not at least one fall, many of us
could count three or four; and one of the ladies was
saved from sliding down a precipice only by our
springing to her help, and holding rider and donkey
against the side of the bank till they had recovered
foot-hold. I had thought that in Indiana, a few
years previously, I had seen the very worst roads in
the world; but they are equalled by those over
Mount Lebanon, that is, if the reader can be made
to understand clearly a comparison between mud-holes
and rocks, which I confess I cannot exactly
do myself. There is no mistake, however, about
this road, which is certainly the most toilsome and
dangerous one that I have ever met with. And yet
it is the great thoroughfare between Damascus and
its seaport, Beirout, and is every day traversed by
camels with heavy loads of merchandise. The
British Consul General for Syria, residing at
Damascus, a few years ago had a carriage transported
across this mountain from Beirout. He first
had it taken to pieces, and then had the body slung
between two camels; but the swinging motion, in
consequence of the roughness of the roads, soon
put the poor animals on beam ends; and they said,
as plainly as camels could say, that they had no
inclination for such work. He then put the vehicle
together again, and employed sixty men to pull it
up and lower it down the precipices, and at last got
it safe home at Damascus, where now he may go an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
airing over a plain 500 miles in length. He offered
the ladies of our party to carry them in it to Palmyra.
A ride in an English coach to Palmyra! it
would have been something new under the sun, and
we should all have made that interesting journey, if
our time would have permitted. But back again&mdash;we
have not arrived at Damascus yet, nor even at
the summit of Lebanon, and many a weary mile is
before us. Up, up we went, sometimes almost perpendicularly,
wondering, when we could catch a
breathing spell, at the power and wonderful surefootedness
of our animals. After a while the
scenery around us became truly grand. It is a
mountain with more poetry than any other that I
have ever seen. Grander I have met with, and richer,
and more beautiful; but I have seen none that contains
so much of all of these combined. The reader is perhaps
aware that it is inhabited by a race of people
that from time immemorial have kept themselves
free and unsubdued; they form an enigma and a
wonder in this land of sloth and imbecility. Hardy,
industrious, and healthful, they have spread over the
mountain till it is teeming with inhabitants, and have
been compelled, wherever, by terrace or otherwise,
it can be cultivated, to erect their dwellings, and
break up or make a soil. They retain also their
peculiar institutions; and this is the only place in
all Turkey where Christians are allowed for their
churches the use of bells.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Mount Lebanon branch off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
into three religions: Mahomedans, Druses, and Maronite
Christians. The last of these had their origin in
the seventh century, and take their name from Maro,
their first bishop, who, at this time, came from the
banks of the Orontes and taught here the heretical
doctrines of the Monothelites, which he had adopted.
In the year 1182 they gave up these doctrines, and
were united to the Romish church; at least they have
ever since acknowledged the supremacy of the Pope,
but as they never allow him to interfere with their
doctrines or forms of worship, and have their own
distinct class of ecclesiastical rulers, their subjection
to the Roman Catholic jurisdiction is little better
than nominal. They have a patriarch whom they
elect themselves, and who takes uniformly the name
of Peter; but his appointment, to be valid, must be
confirmed by the Pope. Their number at present
is about 120,000.</p>

<p>The Druses, who amount to about 70,000, are a
strange and mysterious people. Their religion
seems to be a compound of Paganism, Mahomedanism,
and Christianity; but it is kept a profound
secret, and we have few means of forming a judgment
respecting it. They are divided into two
classes, the <em>Djakils</em>, or <em>ignorant</em>, about 60,000 in
number, and the <em>Aakils</em>, or <em>intelligent</em>, who amount
to about 10,000; the latter alone are acquainted
with the mysteries of their religion; but from the
vague answers that are given to all queries by
strangers respecting it, I am inclined to think that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
is itself vague and undefined, and that except a few
leading principles, they themselves scarcely know
what they believe.</p>

<p>The Mahomedan population, in some parts of Lebanon,
is very numerous.</p>

<p>On our right, as we ascended the mountain, was
a large valley, commencing in the elevated parts of the
range, and spreading, as it descended, till it formed a
theatre among the hills of gigantic proportions.
From the highest part to the lowest, it was all under
cultivation, and dotted with cottages; while in various
parts cascades were seen streaming from the
rocks, and contrasting finely with the rich verdure
with which the whole seemed to be carpeted, and
over which the declining sun was now pouring a
flood of mellowed light.</p>

<p>We turned, by and by, around the head of this
valley, and delighted with the views, but exhausted
by the constant muscular effort to keep in our saddles,
we were glad to find ourselves at the door of
Mr. Bird’s house in the village of Aaleih. In approaching
the village, the young beaux of our party
had straightened themselves in their saddles, and
made their donkeys hold up the head and look
smart, in hopes perhaps of making a conquest
among the princesses of the mountain, some of
whom were residing in Aaleih; but as we passed
the houses, nothing but old looking heads, and these
with great horns stuck on them, were thrust out
towards us, presenting some of the least attractive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and most singular specimens of woman-kind that
we had met with. This is no joke of mine;
for it is actually the fashion in this region for the
ladies to stick to their heads a horn very much in
size and shape like a speaking-trumpet, if deprived
of its mouth-piece. They are generally of embossed
silver, and are handed down from mother to child
through many generations; some are of paste-board
covered with gold or silver paper, and some of the
more costly ones which we saw, in addition to being
of pure silver, were set with precious stones. They
are worn generally on the top of the head, projecting
a little in front; but are sometimes attached to the
side directly over the temple, according as the fancy
may take the belle or her ladyship; they are worn
not only by day, but also during the night. A white
muslin shawl is usually cast over the horn, and tied
with a string at its lower part, and is thus made to
shade the face; their dress in other respects has
nothing peculiar. We priced some of these singular
ornaments, and found them valued at about fifteen
dollars.</p>

<p>The Druse men have squat figures and countenances,
though not very intelligent, yet of rather pleasing
expression. They wear a dress considerably like that
of the Turks, and in addition, a loose coat, marked
with broad white and black stripes running vertically;
this coat, I believe, is universal among them,
and is one of the characteristics of a Druse. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
met them in great numbers along the road, and took
pleasure in marking their habits, so different from
the lazy, sluggish movements of the Turks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bird had been good enough to prepare an
excellent meal for us, to which we sat down with
keen appetites; after which some of us went, in
company with Mrs. B. and Mrs. Whiting, to call
upon the princesses, the daughters of the late Emir
of this district, over which, since his decease, one of
them had been exercising the authority of chief.</p>

<p>There was a house full of females and children,
and we could not help admiring the sprightly, intelligent
faces, and the graceful carriage of all, both
old and young. Their costume was also very becoming.
One of the lads, about eleven years of age,
with a keen resolute eye, wore a handjar<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of beautiful
workmanship in his belt, and had the bearing
of a little king. The young folks came afterwards
to visit the ship, with a letter from Mr. Bird; but
unfortunately did not reach her till she was under
way, and they could not be admitted on board.</p>

<p>Again came our ponies, (alias donkeys, at least
most of them,) and again came the tug of this mountain
travelling, which soon was rendered doubly
unpleasant by a moonless night. We could see
nothing of the way, and had no resource except
quietly to follow Mr. Smith, our guide, and resign
ourselves to the sure-footed habits of our animals.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
We travelled on in this way for about an hour after
dark, when suddenly, and as if by a kind of magic, a
scene opened upon us that produced a general exclamation
of delight. Mr. Smith had selected a safe
spot for the exhibition, and without giving us warning,
had led us to the edge of an immense valley,
which spread around in the form of a great amphitheatre,
and was covered with villages and farmhouses
from top to bottom. The houses had lights
in them, and all at once, from utter darkness, the
whole region, a space of some miles in diameter,
appeared as if sprinkled over with stars; it seemed
as if we had been suddenly carried upward, and
had been placed in mid-heaven, amid the constellations
and the bright effulgence of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>But we were yet upon our earth, and in a very
rough portion of it; and as we went on, climbing
up and slipping down, we began to long for our own
beacon light. It appeared at length on the opposite
side of a deep valley, around which we had to wind;
but at length, about ten o’clock, we were safely
deposited in Mr. Smith’s hospitable dwelling at
Bhamdoon. His house accommodated the Commodore
and family, while the rest of us were distributed
among his neighbors, where we found pretty
comfortable beds.</p>

<p>The rising sun, next morning, found us on our
way, and in addition to our baggage mules, another
in our company, with a couple of tents provided by
Mr. Smith, an accommodation which we found of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
most essential service during the journey. Mount
Lebanon, at the highest peak, which was not far
north of our road, attains an elevation of 10,000
feet; but at our place of crossing was not quite so
high. Opposite to Balbec its summit retains the
snow, even in exposed situations, all the year.</p>

<p>We reached the highest point of our road at a
place about five miles east of Bhamdoon; and after
descending into some deep glens, and encountering
again a frightful rocky ascent, we stopped for breakfast
at 10 o’clock, on the eastern slope of the range. The plain
of Coelo-Syria, apparently about eight miles across,
but in reality of nearly twice that width, was spread
out below us; and on the opposite side of it ascended the
more gentle and less formidable looking mountain
of Anti-Lebanon. At a peak to the southward of
us this latter range was, however, also covered with
snow. Numerous streams dash down the sides of
both mountains, clothing them with perpetual green,
and then discharge their waters into the river Litane,
the ancient Leontes, which, after winding through
the whole length of this plain, is finally lost in the
sea not far from Sidon.</p>

<p>The plain of Coelo-Syria is generally of the
breadth that I have mentioned, and is about 100
miles in length, being bounded in the whole extent
by the parallel ranges of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon.
It has a rich soil, and might be made extremely productive;
but only a small portion of it is at present
under cultivation. Our meal was eaten by the side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of a brook, beneath some fig trees; and when it had
been succeeded by a short season of repose, we
finished our descent, and entered on the monotonous
and fiery plain. All day we dragged ourselves
across, scorched by a fierce sun, and parched with
thirst, and finding little relief in the sight of the
snowy peaks on either side. We came about two
o’clock to a khan, and soon after to the river, which
we crossed on a bridge, though at this season it can
be forded. Here we met a long string of camels
from Damascus, and soon after we witnessed a natural
phenomenon, of which we afterwards saw several
instances on the great Assyrian plain,&mdash;columns
of sand raised high in the air, and passing along the
ground, in their shape bearing a great resemblance to
that of a water-spout, and doubtless produced by a
similar cause.</p>

<p>Our course was not straight across the plain, but inclining
to the southward. About five o’clock we reached
a village near the foot of Anti-Lebanon, and while
we stopped for water, our muleteers began very deliberately
to unload the animals, concluding to stop there
for the night. They were astonished when told that the
day’s journey was not yet finished, and then remonstrated,
and then got angry, but to no purpose; and
I believe they thought us a very singular and
uncivilized set of beings. I do not know that
any traveller has ever yet spoken of the difference
between foreign countries and our own with respect
to energy and rapidity of movement. With us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
“time” literally “is money;” and as we have abundant
opportunities of making the most of it, we get
a sharpness of look, and a quickness of motion,
which is seen no where else, and has at length become
a characteristic of the nation.</p>

<p>The contrast is striking every where, but most of
all along the Mediterranean. A Spanish lad for
whom I lately got an excellent situation with a
mechanic in one of our cities, was near losing it
because “he did not move fast;” although in his
own country he would have been considered smart
enough. I pointed out to him the difference, and
mentioned the objection, and he immediately improved.
There is, in most of these countries, a
heaviness of look, and slowness of motion, in strong
contrast with the bustling, driving character of people
in our cities; but which is easily accounted for by
the fact, that there are fewer stimulants to enterprise
and activity. The journey from Beirout to Damascus,
I believe, usually occupies between three
and four days; although there were ladies in our
company, we made it in two; and let me here also
remark, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>, that as far as endurance of hardships
and of fatigue is concerned, I believe ladies
are quite as good travellers as men; and as far as
my own observation has gone, they are better.</p>

<p>Our determination this evening to proceed, however,
soon brought us into an embarrassment. We entered
the defiles of Anti-Lebanon, and in the course of a
few hours found ourselves shut up in them, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
night settling around us, without knowing where to
stop; and our Armenian friend, driven beyond his
usual land-marks, could now give us no assistance.
Tents we had, thanks to the kindness of Mr. Smith,
and also provisions; but we had to find a stopping-place
where our beasts could get water; and we
passed on, mile after mile, without any indications
of stream or fountain. This mountain is very different
from Lebanon. Though in some places very
high, it is generally much lower, and consists of
rounded eminences, with here and there deep ravines
or glens between. It is also in most places quite
deserted. Along this route we passed but one village
in the whole way across the mountain, and this was a
miserable looking one; nor was there a single house
in the whole intermediate country.</p>

<p>We reached a spot at length where the defile was
succeeded by a narrow plain, and our company, scattering
themselves over the ground in search of water,
a glad shout, at length, from some of the party, informed
us that they had found a spring. The water
came gushing out from the foot of a bluff of rocks,
and beneath them we pitched our tents and lighted
our fires. Some of us then went to filling the pots
for cooking, and some were sent to grope in the dark
after dry thistles for fuel; while others seated themselves
on the rocks and looked up at the stars, and
talked sentiment.</p>

<p>It was a raw cold night; and we were off long
before day, traversing a region as dreary and desolate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
as can be imagined. About ten o’clock we came
to the village just noticed; and then again pursued
our course over hill and along dale, with not even
a butterfly or grasshopper to cheer our course. A
large fountain by and by, and a little herbage near
it, offered some variety; and not long after this we
caught sight of an oasis some miles on our left&mdash;a
little valley of the most intense green, with trees of
majestic form, mingled with the tapering poplar and
cypress, all imbedded among hills of a red and yellow
color, and of unbroken sterility.</p>

<p>The ground before us now began to ascend,
stretching off into elevated plains; and as we advanced,
a traveller was now and then met, or seen
at a distance crossing the country. These signs multiplying,
it was evident that we were approaching
Damascus. We gained, at length, the summit of
a long sloping plain terminated by a bluff;&mdash;and
there&mdash;there was the city.</p>

<p>And it was a scene strikingly oriental and truly
magnificent. We had hit upon the very best way by
which Damascus can be approached, for its gardens,
though far down, were right under our feet. A sea
of intense verdure breaking all at once upon the arid
desert; a great city bursting suddenly from amid the
completest solitude; and beyond it a plain stretching
off&mdash;far off&mdash;till the eye could follow it no longer;&mdash;this
was what we saw as we stood upon those
heights. I believe the plain of Damascus reaches
to the Euphrates, and proceeds on with that river;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and if so, it must be 500 miles or more in length,
and as far as we could see, it is a smooth level, without
hillock or break of any kind. On the eastward,
at a great distance, and forming a dim speck on the
horizon, were some inequalities like mountains; but
to the southward the plain was as smooth as the
ocean in a calm, and apparently as boundless.</p>

<p>The peculiar excellence of the spot where Damascus
is situated is owing to the Barraday, a rapid
stream, which here breaks out from the mountain
ravines; and by numerous artificial as well as natural
channels, is made to spread over the plain; it
waters the whole extent of the gardens, and when
this is done, the little of it that is left proceeds on
southwardly through the plain, but amid the arid
sands it soon dwindles away and disappears. The
stretch of gardens is about nine miles in diameter,
and, except the space occupied by the city,
is one unbroken extent of the deepest verdure. It is
planted with all kinds of trees; mostly, however, such
as produce fruit, among which the apricot still holds
the ascendency; pomegranate, orange, lemon, and
fig trees also abound, and rising over these are other
trees of huge proportions, intermingled with the
poplar and sometimes the willow. Water is carried
into every garden; and as we rode on towards the
city, it was our almost constant companion, dashing
along by our side or through arched ways
under the road, and sending off branches in every
direction. It is here quite a rapid stream. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
gardens are enclosed by brick or earthen walls; and
beside the fruit trees are planted thickly with vegetables
and with flowering shrubs. In the centre of
this wide stretch of verdure, which, as we gazed upon
it from the hills, seemed like an earthly paradise,
is the city itself. Its population is estimated at
100,000; but I should judge it to be greater than
this.</p>

<p>It presents a great mass of houses, but being situated
on the level plain, and having no points of
elevation and but few prominent edifices, it would
not strike us greatly, if it were not mixed up with so
much natural beauty. The great mosque, formerly
the church of St. John, towers considerably above
the rest of the edifices; and so does the dark massive
castle, or citadel, and so also do a few domes and
several minarets; but they are not sufficient to give
it character. But with the scenery around, the gardens,
the adjoining range of Anti-Lebanon, rising in
many a peak and presenting bold precipices, and
with the great plain, so vast that the imagination is
lost in attempting to follow it, <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">El Sham</i>, as by this
time we had learned from the Arabs to call Damascus,
is a place of exquisite beauty. One part of it,
which struck us as we viewed it from our elevated
position, will interest the Christian. It is a narrow
prolongation of the city at the southern end, about
three quarters of a mile in length. Commencing in
the body of the city and extending along through the
whole length of this portion, is “the street which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
called Straight,” still remarkable for its length
and direct course, and still, I was informed, going
by its ancient name. It added greatly to the
interest with which we contemplated these remarkable
and beautiful scenes, to think that here Paul
first looked on nature with the eyes of a Christian,
and amid this scenery found subjects to animate him
in his new and joyful aspirations, and to strengthen
him in his high resolves. Here, in Damascus, “he
first preached Christ, that he is the Son of God.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Late fanaticism of the people of Damascus. Change. Mr. Farrah’s
house. Agreeable disappointment. Costume of the natives.
The Cobcob. Mr. Farran, the English Consul General. Visit
to the palaces. Palaces of Abdallah Bey, &amp;c. Official visit to
the Governor, Sheriff Pasha. Handsome reception. Promises
of the Pasha with respect to Americans in Syria. Mr. Farran’s
beautiful country residence. Bazaars. Damascus blades&mdash;not
to be had. Departure from the city. Night at Mr. Farran’s.</p>

<p>Having rested by a stream at the edge of the
gardens till our straggling party had all come up,
we passed on, and entering one of the city gates,
were soon in a labyrinth of bazaars and narrow
streets. Our large cavalcade attracted considerable
attention as we rode unceremoniously along, our baggage
mules frequently brushing the natives and
forcing for themselves a wide passage amid the
crowds. Many looks of dark and angry import were
turned upon us, but no one offered any molestation;
and with the exception of their scowling looks, they
were sufficiently respectful. It was only about a
year before this that De La Martine, on approaching
the city, found it advisable to stop at one of the
neighboring villages, and change his European for
the Turkish dress. The iron hand of the Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Pasha, wherever it lights, makes itself felt. It is
now as safe to travel in Egypt as in our own country;
and will soon be so in Palestine, and also about
Damascus, which, until quite lately, was, and indeed
probably still is, one of the most fanatical cities in
the world. In this city there has already been a
surprising change. During our visit we went freely
among the bazaars, sometimes all in company, and
sometimes in small parties or singly; and though
attracting such crowds that the streets were often
actually blocked up, and it was difficult for the citizens
to get along, all were respectful; nor, as far as
we know, was even an opprobrious epithet ever
used.</p>

<p>The Armenian gentleman who had been our companion
in the journey, had offered the hospitality of
his house, and now led us on through the city for
nearly a mile, when at length we came to a stand.
We were in a street, narrow like all the rest, (the
bazaars excepted,) and alongside of a house that
seemed to give promise of nothing but poverty. Its
exterior was rough and coarse; and the walls bulging
out here and there, looked as if waiting to tumble
on our heads and crush us, rather than to give
us shelter. We entered by a low narrow door into
a passage, also narrow and dark; and great indeed
was our surprise at the scene which broke upon us
when we reached its further end. We afterwards
visited all the celebrated palaces of the city, and
found the exterior of all of them of a character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
similar to this. On the outside they are coarse and
wretched looking buildings, seemingly ready to
crumble and fall to pieces; and the appearance of
poverty is probably intentional, in order to save the
inmates from the exactions of an arbitrary and
oppressive government. But for this, ample amends
are made in the interior.</p>

<p>The edifice into which we were now introduced
formed a hollow square; the open space within
being occupied by a court, about fifty feet by forty,
all paved with variegated marbles. In the centre of
this was a square fountain, fourteen or fifteen feet
on each side, and rising about two feet above the
pavement. It was filled with gold and silver fishes,
and was lined all around with vases or pots with
flowers. At the further end of the court, the pavement
rose, and here was a recess occupying nearly
the whole width of the court, and about ten feet in
depth. It was fronted by a lofty pointed arch, richly
ornamented with arabesques cut in stone, or painted
in a great variety of gay colors. The back and
sides of the recess were enriched in a similar manner,
every part of them being covered either with
arabesques or with parallel stripes of gay colors,
either in horizontal, or in zigzag or waving lines. I
must except one or two compartments or raised pannels
on each side, with rich borders to them; the
pannels were occupied by stanzas of Arabic poetry
in large letters, either cut into relief, or done with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
paint. At the back of the recess was a broad luxurious
ottoman.</p>

<p>This lofty and magnificent recess, whose effect,
apparently unstudied, is yet very striking, meets us
at once on emerging from the dark passage, and gives
us our first impression of the building; but as we
advance towards it a new candidate for our admiration
is presented on our left. Just before reaching
the angle of the court which adjoins the recess, we
come to a door-way, which is ornamented, but has
no very remarkable pretensions; but as we approach,
the fall of water arrests our attention and invites us
to enter; and on doing so our eagerness to take possession
of the lofty cool recess is suddenly checked. This
room is not very large, its dimensions being altogether
about fifteen feet by twenty-five; and the light
is permitted to enter only in sufficient quantity to
make objects distinct. A short distance within the
door is a circular marble fountain, from the centre of
which a few streaks of water ascend up into the air,
and breaking at the top, fall in a constant shower
of gems, creating a delightful coolness, and a noise
just sufficient to lull one to repose. The floor here
is of tesselated marbles; on each side are marble
slabs attached to the wall, supporting China vases and
other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijouderie</i> of a similar substance. In the
window is a salver containing sherbet and confectionary,
where any person may help himself whenever
his inclinations prompt, the supply being constant
but without parade. About ten feet from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
door the floor suddenly ascends about eighteen
inches, and now it is covered with the brilliant and
soft carpet of Turkey or Persia; while quite around
the recess thus formed runs a broad ottoman, yet
softer and more luxurious than that of the open
court. The walls of this chamber are quite covered
with arabesques, in stucco, or painted in various colors,
among which is also interspersed Arabic poetry.
The ceiling is lofty, and is of wood formed into
small compartments, usually arabesque patterns, the
bottom of the pannels being often composed of mirrors.
The wood itself is colored so as to resemble
japanned work of brilliant colors.</p>

<p>This description will give the reader a general
idea of these two apartments. I am afraid to venture
on a more minute description of them, as his mind
would only be burdened if I should attempt to give
in detail all the ornaments, the projecting cornice in
the Saracenic architecture, and the great variety of
patterns and colors that decked the sides and ceiling
both of the small retired chamber or of the large
recess.</p>

<p>The stone walls of the open court were ornamented
all around with patterns, sometimes cut in the
stone, but usually in paint of brilliant colors,&mdash;red,
blue, white, and yellow, being those chiefly employed.
Sometimes these were put on in horizontal stripes
three or four inches wide; sometimes in waving or
zigzag lines, and sometimes in interlacing circles;
here and there a pannel of fanciful arabesque is introduced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
A person is very much struck with the
exuberance of the eastern fancy in these patterns,
scarcely any two of them being alike; they are generally
in excellent taste.</p>

<p>The reader will think me describing the palace of
a prince; but it was the residence of a private gentleman&mdash;a
merchant, I believe; and I have been so
minute, because it is not a palace, but one of the
edifices common among that class of persons. We
saw more of them; they are all wretched looking on
the outside, but magnificent and luxurious within.</p>

<p>These two chambers form the “parlors” of the
dwelling. At an angle corresponding to that of the
small chamber was a room of a plainer character,
used during our residence in the house as a dining-room.
The remainder of the two sides of the court
was occupied by the sitting room of the females of
the family, and by entrances to the kitchen and to
the offices. Against the end of the court which
faced the large recess, two flights of broad steps
ascended to the right and left, one to the gentlemen’s,
and the other to the ladies’ private apartments.
They were protected from the weather by a broad
ornamented projection of the roof. On entering our
own sleeping apartment, we had before us a passage
about six feet wide, on the left of which was a platform
of small elevation divided by a projecting partition
into two recesses; while on the right was a
similar recess, each of them being about twenty feet
square; along the sides were ottomans raised about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
six inches from the floor, and these being at night
provided with covering, formed our beds. The sides
of this room were also ornamented with arabesques,
and with a great variety of Arabic poetry.</p>

<p>Damascus is by far the most oriental city that I
have seen, and this may serve as a specimen of the
dwellings of the wealthier class.</p>

<p>The ladies of Mr. Farrah’s family came forward
to welcome those of our party; we were led to our
various rooms and told that they were ours; and
then the family retired; nor through the whole of
our stay, though their hospitality was unremitting, was
there any parade or ostentation of service. Our wants
were all supplied, and where this was possible, anticipated;
abundant tables were spread, some gentlemen
of the family generally taking their seats at them, but
seldom eating, giving quiet attention to our wants, and
as quiet orders to the servants; but no one pressed us
to eat or to drink, or spoke of the dishes, or obtruded
any thing on our notice; nor did they come themselves
except when we expressed a wish for their
society. The business of the family seemed to go
on in the usual course, and the only evidence we
had that our presence was felt, was in the unostentatious
supply of our necessities. This was true hospitality;
we received the most essential services, but
without their even seeming to imagine that they were
conferring an obligation, or making us feel uneasy
by allowing us to see that we were disturbing them.</p>

<p>The Moslem inhabitants of Damascus are like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
those of Turkey further north both in their dress and
habits, except that the turban is better adjusted,
and has a smarter and more dandyish look. So at
least we thought; but perhaps we should not have
noticed this, if we had not been led to expect it from
a passage in some book, I believe Hope’s Anastasius.
And the ladies of the city, I suppose, would scarcely
pardon a traveller who should neglect to notice the
cobcob, any more than an American belle would
excuse an eastern traveller who, in speaking of her
costume, would forget to describe the elegant bishops’
sleeves by which she adds to her arms those beautiful
proportions which stupid nature has forgotten
to give her. The cobcob is a kind of&mdash;what shall I
call it?&mdash;stilt? no; this will not describe it&mdash;nor will
shoe, nor yet patten. It is a combination of the excellences
of the stilt and patten. The manufacturer
takes a slip of board, which he cuts to the shape of
the foot; and across this nails an embroidered strap,
through which the foot is to be slipped, and by which
it adheres; next he fits to this board near the ends, two
upright pieces about nine inches in height, narrowed
above to the width of the delicate foot, but spread
out to a breadth of eight inches at the lower extremity.
The whole is now ornamented with mother-of-pearl
in fanciful patterns, and the <em>cobcob</em> is finished and
ready for use. The height that I have given for
them is that of a pair designed for a person of the
wealthier classes; the height, however, is in proportion
to the rank of the wearer; and if the lady be of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
superior grade in society, she disdains to walk with a
cobcob of less than twelve inches in height; while
the vulgar have to be contented with a smaller elevation,
say of five or six inches. Slipping her feet under
the strap, the Damascus belle now rises into the
proper dignity of her station, and is ready to receive
her visitors. Would it not be well for our ladies
to adopt the cobcobs as an excellent accompaniment
to the bishops’ sleeves? In some of our towns they
would be of real service, as they would settle questions
of rank and precedency, by showing us at once
in which class of society the lady considers herself
to rank; whether among the first, second, or third,
or only the ninth or tenth. For an <em>American exclusive</em>,
we would allow a suitable cobcob of three
feet in height.</p>

<p>Joking aside, it was really odd enough to see the
ladies of Damascus going about their houses with
this singular kind of slipper. I have described
exactly the dimensions of a pair which I purchased
in a street almost entirely devoted to the sale of them,
and abounding in them of all sizes, from the proportions
here given, down to those for a child, where
the altitude is not more than a few inches. I saw
none worn in the streets: they use them in the marble
courts of their houses, in the kitchen and nursery,
and in the common household occupations.</p>

<p>The morning after our arrival, Mrs. Farran, the
lady of the English consul-general for Syria, did us
the honor to call, and was good enough to offer to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
accompany us in our visits through the city. Mr.
Farran sent a very kind message, but was unable to
come himself; they were residing at a country-seat
at the foot of the mountains, and Mr. F. having the
day previous to this come to the city on business,
was attacked with a fever. Damascus, in summer,
is a very unhealthy place, and is dangerous to European
constitutions. For the polite attentions of
Mr. and Mrs. F., which were unceasing during our
stay, any thing that I could say would be but a feeble
acknowledgment. We had no claims on them,
not even a letter of introduction; but their politeness
was unremitting, and certainly contributed greatly to
the pleasures of our visit. Mr. Farran, I believe, was
appointed to this station by his government in consequence
of its wish to open a steamboat communication
down the Euphrates with India, and by his intelligence
and tact, and the high esteem in which he is
held by the Pasha of Egypt, has very materially contributed
to the success of that enterprise. Mrs. Farran
was the first lady that had ever ventured to appear
here in the European costume, and the ladies of
our party were the next; lady Franklin, who had
visited the place, having, during her visit, adopted
the national dress.</p>

<p>Having mounted our ponies, we started, under the
guidance of our polite friend, to visit the curiosities
of Damascus; and first proceeded to the palace
of Abdallah Bey, one of the wealthiest persons of
the city. His family is considered the most ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and most noble in Syria, and, we were informed,
had the Pashalik of Damascus for 300 years. Abdallah
has declined office under the Egyptian Pasha,<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and is now a private citizen. His palace, with the
courts and gardens, occupies a large extent of
ground; but I will not fatigue the reader with details.
There are three or four distinct courts, like that
of our own residence already described, but of course
much larger, and in a style of far greater magnificence.
In this palace we counted eight fountains,
several of them with jets. The Bey received us with
great politeness, and showed us through the buildings
himself, after which we were entertained with
coffee, and pipes and sherbet. A hint being here
given by Mrs. F. that the strangers would be pleased
if they could see the ladies’ apartments, the old gentleman
gave orders immediately to have them cleared
of his women-folks; and when this had been done,
led us through the whole establishment. As we proceeded;
a rustling and occasionally a titter behind
the partitions or screens, seemed to indicate that the
females were not far off, and were amusing themselves
with watching us while they themselves were
unseen. This part of the palace is separated from
the rest by a high wall, and consists of a court, with
two large fountains surrounded by orange and lemon
trees and rose bushes, a garden ornamented also
with two fountains and trees, and a range of apartments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
surrounding the court. These apartments
were more splendid than any others in the palace,
the architectural finishing of the chambers being of
the most delicate kind and in exquisite taste. One
room, as we entered, presented a marble fountain in
the centre, in which were seven jets; and looking
through the shower of diamonds that broke from
them, and fell with an unceasing murmur into the
reservoir, we saw, at the further end of the chamber,
a cascade of six or seven feet in height, the water
of which was broken up, and fell amid sculptured
marble cut into a variety of fanciful forms.</p>

<p>In the gentleman’s receiving rooms of the Damascus
palaces is a curious ornament. A few feet below
the ceiling is a broad cornice, supported by Saracenic
sculptures running quite around the room; and
ranged on this is an unbroken line of China bowls of
the largest dimensions that it is possible to procure.
The wealth of the individual is supposed to be indicated
by the number and the size of these bowls. In
one palace I counted near two hundred in a single
room; they are of the finest China, and are colored;
and in rooms where, as in these countries, the only
furniture consists of carpets and ottomans, may assist
in preventing the apartment from looking too
naked; but I did not much admire the taste. Almost
every family has some of these bowls; there were
several in our sleeping room at Mr. Farrah’s, which
we put to the desecrating use of wash-bowls.</p>

<p>From this we proceeded to the palaces of Ali Aga<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and Abdi El Belzah Aga, which were also splendid,
though smaller than that of Abdallah Bey. In one
of them was a chamber not more than fourteen
feet square, the finishing of the walls and ceiling of
which had cost 7000 dollars. They were composed
of mirrors in small compartments, and were further
highly enriched with mother of pearl, gilding, and
with arabesques and Saracenic mouldings in a great
variety of forms.</p>

<p>We finished with Mr. Farran’s town-house or
palace, for such it truly is; and where, to oriental
splendor we found united English elegance and comfort.
The furniture from his own country was made
to harmonize very well with the eastern architectural
taste.</p>

<p>The Commodore in the morning had sent his travelling
firman to the palace of Sheriff Pasha, the
Governor of Syria; and now, while the ladies proceeded
with Mrs. Farran to her country residence,
he went with the officers to make an official visit to
that dignitary. The cavalcade, consisting of the
Dragoman of the English embassy, Cavasses, Mr.
Farrah, and the American officers, had to traverse
the whole length of the city, as the Governor’s palace
is on the south-western end. Sheriff Pasha had
been represented to us as a thorough Turk in his
feelings and manners towards Christians; but owing,
probably, to the firman, he met the party in the court
of his palace, surrounded by his officers, and with a
guard of honor. On being conducted to the audience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
hall, the party found that <em>chairs</em> had been provided
for their accommodation, and he even occupied
a chair himself. The usual compliment of
pipes, &amp;c. was paid; and while smoking, he proceeded
to inquire about our country, showing, as indeed
did most of the Egyptian officers wherever we
visited, a knowledge of our institutions and resources
that we had not expected to find. He spoke of
our late war and our successes on the ocean; and expressed
a strong desire to see the Delaware, of which
he said he had that morning received an account by
letter. His curiosity, he said, would have carried
him over to Beirout to visit the ship, if he had not
been in daily expectation of the arrival of Ibrahim
Pasha. After presenting Mr. Farrah to him as the
agent of our government, and receiving assurances
that on this recommendation he should be received
without the usual formalities of writing to Alexandria,
the Commodore expressed the satisfaction he
felt in the protection and countenance that had been
afforded by Mohammed Ali and the Governor to the
American citizens resident in Syria. The Pasha
replied, “That the citizens of all powers residing in
the kingdom were entitled to protection&mdash;such were
his orders, which it afforded him pleasure to fulfil,
particularly towards the Americans, who had by
their correct conduct and their efforts to do good,
merited protection and favor; and that so long as
he continued in office they should be his peculiar
care, and that he himself would be their <em>consul</em>;”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
he requested, “if we should hear of an American
having suffered injustice or injury, or not having
obtained justice for any injury or insult, that the
Commodore would write to him, and charge him with
neglect of his promise:” and added, “that, in short,
he wanted to be himself American consul in Syria,
and charge himself with the care and interests of all
Americans, who were then, or might afterwards settle,
in Syria, or make it a visit.” The reader is left
to deduct from all this whatever he may consider
as belonging to the usual <em>palavar</em> of such occasions;
but, after all, Sheriff Pasha certainly acted
and spoke in a very handsome manner.</p>

<p>The party, after this interview, proceeded to Mr.
Farran’s country-seat, where we were engaged to
dinner. This is a very beautiful spot. It is quite
near the foot of the mountains, in a north-western
direction from the city, from which it is about two
miles distant. The house stands within a large
enclosure, and has in front a court surrounded
by immense walnut trees intermingled with the
orange and lemon, overhanging a large fountain.
Directly under the windows in the rear rushes
the Barraday, here undivided, and a full rapid stream
of the clearest water. The grounds around the
dwelling are laid out in good taste, and are covered
by an exuberance of foliage, some of the trees being
of prodigious magnitude.</p>

<p>The entertainment was in a style to correspond
to all this; and after such a busy day, good appetites<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
were not wanting to do it justice. It was, indeed,
pleasant, away at Damascus, to meet with a hospitality
so kind and agreeable, and society that
beguiled the thoughts back to one’s father-land: and
the party were easily induced to remain till morning.
Beds, in these countries, are, easily provided,
the broad ottomans only requiring a few sheets in
order to make them excellent places of repose; and
so they are generally used.</p>

<p>The next day was appropriated to a lounge among
the bazaars; and we spent it agreeably, under the
guidance of Mr. and Mrs. Farran, in looking at the
great variety of oriental productions. I have always
taken great pleasure in lounging in a Turkish bazaar;
and it struck me that these of Damascus,
though perhaps less splendid, are more pleasing than
even the great bazaars of Constantinople. One very
pleasing characteristic of them is their great loftiness;
while those of the Turkish capital are low.
The reader will imagine a street, or any succession
of streets, or rather a labyrinth of streets, about fifteen
feet wide, and covered at the height of fifty or
sixty feet by a wooden roof, generally tight, but
sometimes allowing, through the interstices of the
covering or of a huge spreading grape-vine, the sunbeams
to fall in a gentle and chequered light. The
sides of this street are composed entirely of shops,
not very large, and quite open in front; so that the
passengers can easily distinguish every article upon
the well-filled shelves. The floor of the shop is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
raised about three feet, and is carpeted; and in the
centre sits the lord of the little domain, ready for the
call of customers, and in the intervals helping
away the time by means of a book, or a pipe, or it
may be by a nap. From the sides of partitions between
the stores bits of wood project into the street,
and on these are hung specimens of the articles
for sale, silks of various dye, handkerchiefs covered
with vines or with sprigs of gold embroidery;
towels ornamented at their ends in a similar showy
manner; and cashmere shawls, rich enough to turn
almost any brain, except, of course, those of the reader
and myself. Here, as in other oriental cities, the
shops are not mixed up together in the manner usual
with us; but streets, or parts of a street, are appropriated
to the sale of a particular article. One street
has cobcobs; another has slippers; another jewelry;
another arms; another dry goods; another drugs.
We came to one lined with manufactories of cutlery,
and at once scattered along it in search of something
that might be tortured into the boast of “a
Damascus blade;” but all to little purpose. The
gentlemen, seated cross-legged before their anvils,
stared at our questions, and seemed now, for the first
time, to become aware of the celebrity of their manufactures:
and the nearest approach that we could find
to the articles of our search, were some huge, coarse
knives, and a handjar or two. They had, however,
the delicate waving lines of yellow and blue along the
blade, which was one of the characteristics of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Damascus swords, and was occasioned by their being
made of alternate pieces of iron and steel wire; the
former to give them toughness, the latter hardness
and edge.</p>

<p>Here and there, at the corners of streets, we came
to fruit-stands, and in some of the well-filled baskets
I noticed peaches, which I think were the largest
that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>The appearance of such a large party in the
French dress seemed to rouse the people from their
natural apathy, and the streets sometimes became so
crowded as to be uncomfortable. We were, however,
always treated with politeness, and found them
ready to gratify our curiosity with regard to their
wares: if we purchased, well: if not, well: the
muscles of the dignified and composed features of
the merchant were equally unmoved.</p>

<p>We might have spent a much longer time very
agreeably at Damascus, and were urged also to proceed
on to Palmyra; but our time was limited; and
towards the close of the second day we bade adieu to
the hospitable family of Mr. Farrah, by which we had
been so kindly entertained. Our faces were now
turned towards Balbec, which was not far out of our
way back to the ship; and as Mr. Farran’s house
was on the road to that city, he had insisted on our
coming out this evening and spending the night under
his roof.</p>

<p>Having filed out at the north-western end of the
city, we came, soon after leaving it, to a large burying-ground,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
where the graves, covered with solid
masonry, which was plaistered and whitewashed,
showed a pleasing attention to the dead. The whitewash
looked as if frequently renewed, and every part
of the ground was clean and in good order. The
appropriate cyprus, however, was wanting; nor was
there any other tree, or even a shrub. Beyond this,
we entered among the gardens once more; and were
immediately surrounded by trees of venerable appearance
and majestic growth, and by cottages and
country-houses, and gushing streams. In our own
country, majestic forest trees and streams of all dimensions
are common things, and the reader may
wonder at the enthusiasm which we felt when such
objects were met with in our journeyings: our enthusiasm
was owing to two causes&mdash;the rarity of such
things about the Mediterranean was one, and the
other cause was the fact that they are common at
our home: they brought home to our minds, more
vividly perhaps than any other objects could have
done; and no one who has not made the experiment
can tell how dear, at the end of a few years’ absence,
our father-land becomes.</p>

<p>Alighted at Mr. Farran’s, however, we could not
feel that we were in a strange country. A pleasant
evening succeeded an agreeable day, and when we
stretched ourselves on our couches, the gurgling of
water on either side of the house lulled us to
repose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Sunrise on the plain of Damascus. Mountain Mosque. Superstition
of the natives of Damascus. Mountain course of the Barrady.
Tomb of Abel. Fountain of Rosalyn. Toils of travel.
Comforts on the road to Pompeii. Ruins of Balbec. The great
Temple and its courts. Stones of prodigious size. A gem in Architecture.
The circular Temple. Gleanings with regard to
their history. Pasha of Balbec. Marshal Bourmont. Cedars
of Lebanon. Town of Zahle. Night in our tents on Lebanon.
Attack by the natives. Return to the ship.</p>

<p>Early dawn on the 6th of September found us
prepared for our journey. We took an early breakfast,
and then, accompanied by our kind host and his
lady, began to wind up the steep ascents that lie just
back of his house. The scene was strikingly oriental.
Two negro lads, attendants of Mr. Farran,
dressed in the gay and fanciful costume of this region,
and mounted on spirited animals, were amusing
themselves with making their horses fly at full speed
up the precipices, and with darting to and fro across
our path. The air was perfumed with the odors of
the orange and jessamine: the gardens had been
steeped in dew, and seemed to welcome the god of
day, which now rising on the edge of the boundless
plain, filled it all with glory, and hung the mountain
sides with splendid purple and roseate hues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>At the summit of the eminence, we passed a little
out of our way, to examine a religious edifice of the
Moslems, erected, I think, on the spot where Mahomet
is said to have alighted to take once more a
look at Damascus, while on his way to heaven. In
the estimation of Mahommedans, Mecca is first in
sanctity: next is Jerusalem; and next is Damascus,
which they call the Prophet’s Heel: the plain
adjoining this city is the rendezvous for the great
northern caravan of pilgrims for Mecca, and in the
gains which the citizens draw from this source, together
with the fresh and ardent zeal which the pilgrims
bring with them and diffuse around, we may
find the cause of the proverbial fanaticism of this
city.</p>

<p>I saw a curious specimen of their superstitions
the second day of our visit, while I was traversing
one of the principal bazaars. The street had been
well filled, but it suddenly became thronged; and
turning to see the cause of this, I found a party of
them leading a horse, on which was seated a young
man, without any clothing, looking around him
with a wild and vacant stare. He was an idiot,
and was regarded by them as a saint; and they
were leading him about to receive the homage of the
people. As he passed slowly along, all treated him
with, the highest respect.</p>

<p>At the Mountain Mosque we took leave of Mr. and
Mrs. Farran, with many sincere thanks for their
kindness; and then set ourselves adrift once more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
on the broad range of Anti-Libanus: the relative of
our Armenian host, however, still keeping us company
and acting as a guide. Our road was considerably
to the northward of the one by which we had
come to Damascus; and followed up the course of
the Barraday, which here, far down in a narrow glen,
was spluttering impatiently among the rocks. At
intervals the precipices receded from its banks, and
left a level spot, which was always occupied by cottages
and trees. This route across the mountain
was, indeed, in fertility and beauty, the very reverse
of the one by which we had come; and our ride was
far more pleasant than we had anticipated. At the
distance of five or six miles from Damascus we came
to the green valley which had attracted our attention
a few days before, and we found here a large
village quite imbedded in verdure. By noon the
river had lost three fourths of its magnitude; but it
still kept up a streak of verdure and of profitable cultivation
amid the mountain solitudes.</p>

<p>The route which we were following no doubt
passes over the ground occupied by the ancient highway
from Damascus to Balbec, and must have been
once much travelled. We passed, about noon, along
the sides of a romantic and deep ravine, where
the road had been cut with great labour among the
rocks of calcareous tufa; and here we had for our
contemplation and antiquarian speculations an ancient
aqueduct, carried among and sometimes
through the precipitous rocks. In the face of the opposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
cliffs were a great many openings to artificial
subterranean chambers, probably in old times
the dwellings of anchorites, to whose taste the wild
and desolate grandeur of the place must have been
well adapted. After passing several villages during
the day, we came, after dark, to another at the side
of a large and beautiful fountain; and here, amid the
barking of dogs and the jabbering of the wondering
natives, we stopped and pitched our tents under
some venerable looking olive trees. The reader
may form some idea of the security which we felt
in these exposed encampments, when I mention that
we never set a guard, or took any particular precaution
with regard to our baggage; nor was a single
article ever stolen.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock of the next day, we passed,
among an amphitheatre of hills, the head waters of
the Farrady, which here bursts into daylight amid a
little paradise of verdure; thence our course was
generally over high and barren ridges, deserted by
the very insects. As we approached once more the
plain of Coelo-Syria, we reached another stream, and
soon after this we passed on our left the <em>Tomb of
Abel!!</em> still in good repair. As such, at least, is
regarded, both by Musselmen and Christians, a grave-shaped
mound of earth, 113 feet in length. Near it
are two pillars, on which Abel is said to have presented
his offerings; and they tell us that yearly, in
the month of December, fire descends from heaven
and rests on their summit. “As I did not see this,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
says El Devoto Perigrino, “and it is told me by
Christians who are not very scrupulous, I have not
given it much credit.”</p>

<p>Proceeding on, again over bare and desolate ridges,
we came, at 1 P.M. to where a gorge in the mountain
obstructed our path, and casting our eyes to the left,
we saw, just beyond its outlet in the plain of Coelo-Syria,
a profusion of majestic ruins.</p>

<p>These were the temples of Balbec.</p>

<p>At the head of the little valley at our feet we saw
also a fountain, so large and clear, and cool-looking,
that it immediately acted as a magnet, and we determined
to be the companions of the Naiads during our
visit here. So our tents were pitched beneath some
fine spreading trees, on a green island formed by
the branching of the waters, a few yards from the
fountain.</p>

<p>This fountain, called Rosalyn by the natives, is
about fifty feet in diameter, and lies embosomed among
gently sloping hills, the only opening being on the
west of it, where the eye rests on the ruins of Balbec,
and beyond them, on the snowy summits of Lebanon.
Towards one side of it is a small island,
on which, and also on the main land adjoining, are
ruins, apparently of an ancient temple; but at present
it is impossible to determine their character.</p>

<p>Having pitched our tents, and disposed our baggage,
and cooled our feverish faces in the stream,
we prepared&mdash;to visit the ruins? no, but to take a
nap. And there was good philosophy in this; for he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
who, after a long journey to see an interesting object,
rushes up with eyes full of dust and faculties all jaded,
does injustice to it, and gets but a modicum of
satisfaction himself. If he would enjoy it to the full,
let him first get a comfortable meal and then a little
repose: the world, and every thing in it, will then be
quite a different affair. If the reader’s journeying
has been altogether in fancy or in books, he can
have no idea how much the traveller’s pleasures are
curtailed by these every day wants and feelings; and
how often, when he expected to be in raptures, they
keep him in incessant torments. “How magnificent
are those ruins,” says enthusiasm to him: “yes,
but how burning hot this sun,” says his poor, red,
scaly face: “why don’t you break out into rapturous
exclamations at this splendid colonnade?” cry upbraidingly,
reason, and taste and fancy, all combined.
“Why, I can’t,” he groans pettishly; “don’t you see
my mouth is parched up with thirst, and my tongue
is as dry as if it belonged to a mummy.” “Come,
come, look,” exclaims his guide; “here, this way is
something truly wonderful!” “What! away there,”
he answers; “why I am already almost inanimate
from fatigue, my feet are blistered, and that roll down
yonder precipice has left me in the state of a mere
jelly.”</p>

<p>The reader has doubtless often thought that he
would like to walk the streets of the disentombed
Pompeii, and has been in raptures as he imagined himself
amid its remains. Yes, but let him first imagine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
himself <em>on the way to it</em>; for travelling does not give
one the power of the magic Arabian lamp. Well, let us
suppose him making the experiment of getting there.
In the first place, if he does not desire the comfort of
being cheated out of four times the honest price for the
conveyance, he has to bargain at Naples&mdash;no, that is
not the word&mdash;he has to get angry, and scold and
quarrel, or at least to go through the appearance of
all this, about his carriage; also about the fare to
him who drives, and to him who rides behind; and
perhaps about the price of the horses’ feed. You start
at length; and, except that in the thronged road one
is in constant dread of jolts or an upset, all goes on
well for a little while; but the beggars,&mdash;here they
come: they mark the foreigner at a distance, and are
really such pitiful objects that one’s heart bleeds for
them. The way up hill is occupied by the aged, or
by cripples, or by the blind with a boy to lead them:
the level spots by the more robust: and the descent
by children, who start from the side of their haggard
parents, and cry “miseracordia, famine, sickness,”
till your ears tingle, and your fancy is filled with
all kinds of diseases and their associations. And the
dust, the dust! you are now off from the paved
streets of Resina, and a hundred vehicles besides
your own are kicking up dust enough to satisfy the
ambition of twenty Napoleons: it settles on your
new coat, and fills your eyes, and sets you to sneezing;
and still amid it all you hear the cry of “miseracordia,”
“orphans,” “famine,” “disease.” Next comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
a long level spot, and here the beggars leave you; and
now start up a dozen urchins, who seem so many
Mercuries with winged feet, so rapidly do they follow
your godship as you sail along in the cloud&mdash;of
dust. They would pick your pockets, too, if they
could. And now look at them; they turn heels over
head, and making a wheel of their extended arms
and legs, whirl along by your side: they make music
for you by chuckling their chin with the fist; they
pick up the dust, and, rubbing it all over their faces,
then grin and wriggle, and look like so many imps
escaped up from the flames of Vesuvius: and you
try in vain to bribe them to stay behind by tossing
them some money. They pick it up, and follow you
for more. At last you are at the gate of Pompeii,
and your carriage comes to a halt; but here, children,
with all kinds of deformed limbs, crawl about,
and dragging themselves to your feet, call upon you
for compassion. And while you yield to pity and
think you are doing a charitable act, you are filled
with horror on being informed that, in the opinion of
physicians who have examined them, their limbs
have probably been distorted thus on purpose, in order
to make them objects of charity; and that you
have been only encouraging their inhuman masters
in their iniquitous gains. But at length you are in
the city, and you hope now to be at peace. No.
You are accompanied all through it by a soldier, who
tells you plainly, by his looks and by his manner of
watching you, that he believes you only want an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
opportunity to turn thief and steal some of the relics;
and he expects too to be paid for his strict attentions.
And you will find a dozen official showmen there,
expecting to be paid, and they would not be satisfied
if you were to spend a fortune in presents to them.
And no matter how liberal you may have been,
when you go away you leave behind you faces, looking
at least, as if they thought you mean. The
rogues! how indignant you feel at them! And this
is the strongest feeling which you carry away with
you, and it ever afterwards is associated in your
mind with Pompeii.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a plain account of a visit to Pompeii.
How greatly obliged, then, are the public, to those
writers who enable them to travel without the vexations
of travel; and to grow sentimental or to
grow wise, without growing&mdash;hungry; for I will warrant
to every man by the time he gets from Pompeii
to Naples, not only a good covering of dust, but a
famous appetite.</p>

<p>And yet, I suppose the reader is scolding because
I have not already set him down quietly among the
ruins of Balbec, forgetting that we ourselves had yet
a walk of two miles through the hot sun before we
could reach them.</p>

<p>These ruins of Balbec, which stand here without
a history and without a name, are indeed worthy of
all the admiration that has been bestowed upon
them. They are at one side of the present village
or town of Balbec, a miserable place of a few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
hovels, and in no wise diverting the attention
from them as we approach: its squalid appearance,
perhaps, heightens their effect. They rise high
above all other objects, so as to be conspicuous at a
great distance; and as we approach, our wonder and
admiration are mingled with sadness to think that
such magnificent edifices should have been so mutilated
by the hand of violence and of time; and yet
this sadness increases our interest in them.</p>

<p>Our attention was first directed to the most perfect
of the temples; but, as we entered at the wrong
end of the structures, and soon got our ideas confused
amid the masses of ruins, I believe the reader would
rather be excused from accompanying us; so I will
first state their appearance in ancient times, when
there was great regularity and symmetry in them,
and then describe them as they are at present.</p>

<p>They stood, then, on an artificial platform of
stone, raised on the plain of Coelo-Syria to a height
varying, according to the inequalities of the plain,
from thirty to forty feet. This was about half a
mile from the chain of Anti-Libanus. The platform
was adapted in shape to the structures upon it, the
complete length being 900 feet and the greatest
width about 420. The entrance was from the east.
At that end was a flight of about fifty steps, 180 feet
in length: at the top of this was a range of twelve
columns, each fifty-one inches in diameter, with an
interval of nine and a half feet between. The visitor
was admitted between them into a covered vestibule,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
250 feet in length by 36 in width; this was adorned
at the extremities with square columns, while the
side opposite to him was ornamented with semi-columns,
and also with niches, and, above these,
with tabernacles; both the latter being occupied by
statues. Crossing this vestibule, he might leave it
either by a large central passage or by a smaller one
at each side of this, and would then find himself in
an open hexagonal court, 150 feet wide and 200 at
its greatest length. This court had at its sides, on
his right and left, four exedrae, or chambers for
schools, open in front, and ornamented each with
four columns and pilasters: the intervals between
these were taken up with chambers for the high
priests and with niches for statues. The whole court
was thus surrounded by columns and pilasters, except
in the front. In this part was a passage 78
feet wide, with two side passages, giving admittance
into the great court of the temple. This court
was 380 feet square, and, except in the front and at
the entrance, was surrounded by square exedrae,
alternating with others of a semi-circular shape: the
former had each four columns and two pilasters, and
the latter two columns with pilasters at their front.
At the entrance into this court were colossal niches,
and at the angles were chambers for the priests.</p>

<p>The great temple, which stood at the further
end of this court, and facing the visitor as he entered,
was 200 feet long by 160 in width. It had ten
columns at each end, and nineteen at each of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
sides;<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> they were seven feet in diameter, and the
details of the whole edifice were of the same colossal
proportions: they allowed eight feet ten inches
for the intervals between the columns. There
are still remaining three rows of stones, supporting
the platform on which this temple stands,
which are of remarkable dimensions. In the lowest
tier they measure severally 35, 33, 32, 31, and 38
feet in length; with a height of thirteen feet and a
breadth of ten feet five inches, exclusive of their
mouldings. In the second row, which is twenty-seven
feet from the ground, they are generally of the
same size, but here are three measuring 64, 64, and
63 feet in length, with their other dimensions to
correspond. In the quarry on the side of the mountain
adjoining this, is a stone cut loose, that measures
seventy feet in length by fourteen in width, and
fourteen feet five inches in depth: the weight of
this is estimated at 1,135 tons.</p>

<p>Of this colossal temple, nine of the columns of
one side, with a portion of their entablature, are all
that now remains: its foundations may still be
traced, and a few huge fragments are scattered
about; but if it was ever completed, it has served as
a quarry for more modern structures, perhaps for
some that were erected by Constantine, for its area
and the environs are pretty well cleared: but the
great columns, standing thus naked and alone, produce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
a very powerful effect. Of the ranges of exedrae,
columns, &amp;c., which formed the sides of the
square and hexagonal courts, and of the vestibule,
there are still large remains; but so broken and defaced
by time and human violence, that it is often
difficult to ascertain their shape or proportions. The
ground is covered over with their ruins. In one
corner of the square court are some large columns
of the red Egyptian granite: they are of peculiar
beauty, and though they have been exposed to the
weather for so many centuries, their polish has
scarcely been at all affected.</p>

<p>It is sad to walk over this great platform and
mark the desolations that have been wrought amid
such architectural beauty. A few yards, however,
from this is a temple of the same age, still almost
perfect, and probably the most splendid specimen of
the Corinthian order of architecture that the world
now can boast. It stands also on a platform of
stone, and was reached by a stair-way of thirty-two
steps: it is about twenty-five feet from the south-west
angle of the great court just described, and also
faces the east. It is peripteral; that is, with a range
of columns quite around, and has also another range
at the front, forming a vestibule: the length is 280
feet, the breadth 122. There were fifteen columns on
each side and eight in front (the angular columns
counted twice), or forty-two in all; to which we are
to add eight for the vestibule, six in front and one
at each side. Of these, thirty-three are now entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and erect, and nine in a ruinous condition; the
eight front columns are missing, but those of the
vestibule remain. The sides of the interior were
also ornamented with half columns, six on each
side; between these were niches for statues, with
ornamented lacunari (arched coverings), and above
the niches were tabernacles, also for statues. The
further end was occupied by a platform, reached by
a broad flight of fifteen steps, and on this was placed
the statue of their divinity. The interior is also in
tolerably good preservation. This temple belongs
to the florid age of architecture; its ornaments are
exuberant and exceedingly rich; the doorway is
decorated with vines and foliage, amid which children
are sporting; the pannels of the ceiling are
occupied by figures of gods and goddesses in relief;
in short, Sculpture has here joined her graver sister
Architecture, and they have worked together harmoniously,
and have produced&mdash;what is very seldom
produced&mdash;a building where great exuberance
of ornament is united with delicacy, and chasteness,
and simplicity. This building is, indeed, a
gem in the art.</p>

<p>South-eastward from these, at the distance of
about 300 yards, is a pretty little thing, though of
more objectionable taste. It is a temple, circular
within, the diameter being thirty-two feet. It is
on an ornamented platform or substructure, and the
floor was reached by a flight of about fifteen steps;
the front presents this flight of steps and a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
door-way, with two Corinthian columns at each
side. The rest of the exterior is formed by a
succession of great niches for statues, five in
number, with a Corinthian column at the sharp angles
between them. The exterior diameter of the
building, from column to column, is sixty-four feet.
The interior is highly ornamented, and has a double
range of semi-columns one above the other, one range
Ionic, the other Corinthian. This little temple answers
very well by way of variety, and for employing
the power of contrast; and is placed just at the
proper distance from the other colossal structures to
make the effect very good. Winding around its
foundations, and murmuring amid its broken, prostrate
columns, is the clear brook from the fountain
of Rosalyn. As we listened to the sound of its waters,
we could almost imagine it to be the voice of pure
and holy Nature chanting the dirge of the unhallowed
worship that once was prevalent here.</p>

<p>It is very strange that, in order to learn the origin
and design of these splendid structures we are compelled
to turn over a variety of ancient books; and
that, after all, the information we glean is sufficient
only to tantalize, and not to satisfy our curiosity. Its
whole amount, I believe to be as follows:</p>

<p>Macrobius informs us that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the city called Heliopolis<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the Assyrians worship the Sun
with great pomp, under the name of Heliopolitan Jove; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
statue of this god was brought from a city in Egypt, also called Heliopolis,
when Senemur or Senepos reigned over the Egyptians, by
Opias, ambassador of Delebon, king of the Assyrians, together with
some Egyptian priests, of whom Partemetis was the chief; and it remained
long among the Assyrians before it was removed to Heliopolis.... The
statue is of gold, representing a person without
a beard, who holds in his right hand a whip, charioteer-like, and in
his left a thunderbolt, together with ears of corn; all which mark
the united powers of Jupiter and the Sun.”</p></div>

<p>From this he infers that the divinity was both Jupiter
and the Sun: he adds that the temple excelled
in divination, and that Trajan consulted it about his
Parthian expedition. Macrob. Saternalia, lib. 1.</p>

<p>Lucian, who was a native of Syria, speaks of a
great and ancient temple in Phœnicia, the rites of
whose worship were brought from Heliopolis in
Egypt; and adds, that “many persons assert that this
temple was erected by Deucalion, the Scythian; that
Deucalion, in whose days the grand inundation of
waters took place.”</p>

<p>All this refers to this spot and to the origin of
these temples, but not to these temples themselves:
the structure to which Lucian refers being evidently
of more ancient date. The first clear and authentic
information which we have of the edifices now standing,
are in John of Antioch, surnamed Malala; who
says, that Aurelius Antoninus Pius erected a great
temple to Jupiter at Heliopolis, near Libanus in
Phœnicia, which was one of the wonders of the
world.</p>

<p>The Chronicon Paschale informs us, that Theodosius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
converted the great and famous temple of Heliopolis
into a Christian church.<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The florid architecture of these edifices corresponds
exactly to the times of the Antonines; and I think
we are at liberty to infer, from what we can gather
on this subject, that there was here, in very ancient
times, a famous temple, containing the statue of Jupiter
Igneous, if I may use the term; and that its
celebrity led the first of the Antonines, who distinguished
himself by building up decaying cities, to
erect these vast and beautiful structures. Close adjoining
them on the south, is a dark, heavy, and ancient
looking building, without windows, and composed
of stones, pannelled like those which I saw at
the foot of Mount Moriah; and this may, perhaps,
be the original temple noticed by Lucian.</p>

<p>The modern Balbec contains about 200 houses.
It is protected by a low wall, but not more than half
the enclosure is occupied by the dwellings, which
are small and miserable looking hovels. As we were
leaving the ruins in the evening, we received an invitation
from the Pasha to make him a visit, which
the lateness of the hour led us to decline. But his
house was adjoining our road back to the fountain;
and on approaching it, we found the gates wide open,
and a train of attendants marshalled for our reception;
so there was no help for us, and our party entering,
filled his little hall of audience. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
disposed to be sociable, and regaled us with pipes,
coffee, and apples; and we regretted that our time
would not permit a longer visit.</p>

<p>It was now dark, and on leaving his house we
found that he had had the politeness to have torches
provided for us. They consisted of bits of pine, piled
up in small baskets made of iron hoops, and elevated
at the end of a long pole. As we wound around or
over the undulations of the valley, the effect of the
broad lights and shadows, the dancing waters in the
pebbly brook by our side, and the oriental costume
of the natives, numbers of whom were accompanying
us, was very fine.</p>

<p>During the day some other travellers, in the native
costume, stopped for an hour or two by our
fountain. We had no conversation with them, but
were afterwards informed that they were probably
the French Marshal Bourmont and some friends,
travelling in disguise.</p>

<p>September 6. We stopped again, an hour or two,
at the ruins, and then commenced re-crossing the
plain of Coelo-Syria, directing our course transversely
so as to strike our former route over Mount Lebanon.
Had our time permitted, we should have
visited the cedars of Lebanon, which are about half
way between Balbec and Tripoli; but as the autumn
was advancing, and the Commodore was anxious to
get away from this unknown coast, the project was
relinquished. Mr. Chassaud was good enough, however,
afterwards to procure some of the wood for us, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
to forward it by way of Marseilles to our wintering
station at Mahon. I have had my portion of it cut into
veneers, which are greatly admired by cabinet
makers, both for the color and odour of the wood;
the interior of the block is of a golden yellow color,
and some portions, which are sprinkled over with
small black specks or knots, are very beautiful. The
number of the old trees has been gradually diminishing
since the mountain first began to be visited
by travellers, and but seven or eight are now remaining.
The largest of these are ninety feet in height,
and they have in one or two cases a circumference
of forty feet; which, however, like that of the great
chestnut on Mount Etna, is not the circuit of a single
tree, but of the generation that has grown around
the original trunk. The natives have an annual
religious festival beneath these venerable fathers of
the forest. There are groves of a younger growth
around these, containing altogether about 400 trees.
A fine large tree of this species may be seen in the
garden of plants at Paris; and in Mr. Prince’s garden
at Flushing is a young one also, in a flourishing
condition.</p>

<p>About half way across the plain, we came to another
large fountain, and smaller ones occurred at
intervals; but the ride was wearisome enough: in
the whole distance we passed not a house, nor a tree,
nor a speck of cultivation; a withering and blighting
influence has been for ages upon all this region.
About three o’clock, we reached the village of Zahle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
at the foot of Lebanon. It has rather a modern appearance,
having grown up lately in consequence of
some violence and exactions on the other side of the
plain, from which the inhabitants have taken refuge
under the wing of the princes of Lebanon. It is
quite refreshing to an American traveller to see a
modern town, and this of Zahle is also particularly
pleasing from its situation. It is built on unequal,
broken ground, and is bordered on one side by a
deep, shaded ravine, along the bottom of which
dashes a torrent, singing and making melody in its
joyful course. We found near its banks a convenient
spot for satisfying our now ravenous appetites, and
then, although we had no ruins to inspect afterwards,
we again sought the reviving effects of a nap.</p>

<p>And well it was for us that we did so, for we were
destined on the following night to have no repose.
Having travelled on from Zahle in the coolness of
the evening, we came at dusk to our breakfasting
place of the 2d., and here determined to pitch our
tents. But that was to be a night of fighting and
not of sleep.</p>

<p>There is a set of natives on this mountain, the
most thievish beings in all the country, with the reputation
also of being blood-thirsty and merciless,
and waiting to pounce upon every unprotected traveller
that may come in their way. They are a small
race, but are said to be numerous; and the traveller
across these mountains must be on his guard, or he
will be very apt to be plundered by them. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
carry a concealed dagger, with which they are very
expert, and which they do not hesitate to use when
there is occasion for it. They are cowardly, and seldom
make their attacks except in covert places or
by night: and their cunning and malevolence are
said to be equal to their cowardice. We had met
them occasionally, and had generally been on our
guard; but there seemed to be no particular danger
this night, and we took no unusual precautions.</p>

<p>But they were lying here in ambush; and we had
scarcely blown out our lights, and wrapped ourselves
in our blankets for repose, when they made a
sudden attack&mdash;how many there were, we could not
tell in the darkness, but their number must have
been very great. We sprung up, and seizing such
weapons as were handiest, repelled our assailants,
and forced them to a speedy retreat; but not before
several wounds had been given and received. I
think it probable that some of the enemy were killed.
And now we sat down to consult upon the best mode
of preventing another attack. Some advised shifting
our encampment; some concluded to sit up; and
others, amid the confusion of counsel, again yielded
to drowsiness, and tried once more to seek repose.
But hope of repose was vain: we carried on a skirmishing
with them all night, and, notwithstanding
our resistance, many of the enemy in the dark succeeded
in carrying off the plunder, which was
their object.</p>

<p>I should certainly caution all travellers over Mount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Lebanon against pitching their tents, as we had done,
in an old stubble field swarming with fleas.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, we made an early start on
the morrow. Our journey back offered nothing
new, and after stopping to pay our respects to Mr.
and Mrs. Smith, and to thank them for their kindness,
we picked our way down the mountain, and
towards evening took up, once more, our quarters
in the Delaware.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>


<p class="chapblock">Sensation produced by the Delaware. Effect of this visit on the
cause of Missions in Syria. Service on the Sabbath on board,
and the crowds attending. Crowds attracted by this ship during
her whole cruise. Appearance of the ship. Her effect on the
visitors. Progress of free principles throughout the world. The
cause of humanity secure. Our own Country, and its prosperity.
Adieu to the reader.</p>

<p>We found, that during our absence the ship, having
taken in water, had changed her anchorage,
and was now lying abreast of the city, and but a
short distance off. A vessel of her class had never
appeared along this part of the coast before; and
on her arrival she immediately began to attract observation.
A few of the citizens visited her, and
found no difficulty in getting admittance on board:
they carried news of this to the shore; other visitors
came; her fame soon spread far and wide; and in
a short time she was all the rage. Mr. Chassaud’s
house was thronged by applicants for tickets of admission
(the impression having gone abroad that
they were useful), and the street to it was so crowded,
that it was often difficult to get along. He computed
the number who visited the ship here at
40,000; but, although this was perhaps above the
reality, it was still prodigious. Some persons came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
two days’ journey simply for this purpose; and the
city was thronged to such a degree, that provisions
rose to double their former price. They came, old
men, women and children, Druses and Mahommedans,
princes and laborers: all seemed to be seized
by the mania; and, until the day of our leaving
(the 11th of September), there was a constant throng
from early in the morning till dusk. Such a sensation
had probably never been produced here before
by any object of curiosity.</p>

<p>I believe our visit has been beneficial to the interesting
mission at this place. Mr. Bird, at my request,
preached on board on the first Sunday of our
stay here, and Mr. Smith on the second; and
during the latter service, the visitors from shore
were suffered to be present. Generally, visiting was
not permitted on the Sabbath till public worship
had been concluded; but on this occasion they were
admitted, and allowed to stay; and when the crew
were called up to worship, they came up also to
witness the services. Our upper deck has a clear
sweep of 225 feet in length: the whole is covered
by an awning, elevated twelve or fifteen feet, with
side pieces of canvass reaching down to the hammock-cloths,
and thus forming a complete chamber.
The poop-deck, on this occasion, is occupied chiefly
by the band in their uniform: the officers stand by
the capstan, and from this aft, on the starboard side:
the larboard side is occupied, in front, by the ship’s
boys, with prayer-books; then by the marines in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
full uniform; and, back of these, by the seamen, who
also stretch along by the mainmast on either side.
All are in their “first best” clothes; and our ship on
these occasions presents an air of thorough cleanliness
and neatness which, I do not hesitate to say, I
have never yet seen a church on shore present.
Mr. Smith’s discourse was suited to the occasion,
and was listened to by officers and seamen with
deep interest; and I have no doubt that the scene
made an impression on the minds of the mountaineers
which will materially advance the success of the
mission.</p>

<p>Probably no ship has ever floated on the water
that has attracted so much attention, or drawn so
many visitors, as the Delaware during this cruise.
The number of visitors, I think, may be safely estimated
at about 200,000. At Naples, at Palermo,
and at this place particularly, there was a constant
throng from morning till night. No one was denied
admittance; they were allowed to go freely through
the ship, and, when the Commodore or Captain were
absent, were admitted also into their cabins. At
Naples the visitors were from all parts of Europe, a
very large portion of them being from the interior
of Germany. They saw a vessel, not only effective
as regards her battery, but everywhere showing a
neatness and a completeness of finish that must
have astonished them. This ship, like some others
of our seventy-four’s, has a deceptive appearance at
a distance, seeming to be smaller than she is, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
less effective. When they got on board, they found
a battery of ninety-four guns, the greater portion of
them of the largest calibre; the decks high and wide,
and in every part scrupulously clean; and a sufficient
attention to ornament, which was all, however,
made subservient to the main design of efficiency.
She is a very powerful ship, and so she appeared on
inspection; and was also a very handsome vessel.
The most perfect order also prevailed in every part.
The impression which she gave must have been a
favorable one; and I believe that the Delaware, in
this cruise, did more towards advancing the rights
of man, than if she had come home with a dozen
captures of bulk and power equal to her own.
Around the world the voice of freedom and of
humanity is beginning to make itself heard. In
many places it is only a still small voice, but it is
yet heard; and though people often scarcely know
what it means, yet there is a feeling in their breasts
that more or less responds, and tells them that what
it says is the truth. They have heard, too, that
there is a republic somewhere, in a distant land,&mdash;a
country of free principles and equal rights. They
cannot tell how the system operates; but this system,
as far as they know it, is a beautiful one, and
they would like greatly to know more of it. A ship
comes among them from that far country, and their
vague floating visions now take a more substantial
form. It is a vessel bearing signs of wealth and
power, marked by good order and efficiency: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
country that has sent out this ship must be wealthy
and prosperous, enterprising and successful. This
is the lesson which is taught by all our ships
wherever they go; and taught in a manner that is
intelligible to the lowest capacity.</p>

<p>And to this noble and glorious cause of humanity
we bid prosperity and success. Yes,&mdash;may Heaven
sustain and bless it! I am not a politician, but I
hope I am a philanthropist; and, next to religion, I
love my country and its institutions, for I believe
that in them is the regenerating principle that is
going to awaken and vivify the world. These
plains that we have just been passing over, abounding
in a rich soil and under a prolific sky, why are
they not cultivated? But they <em>will</em> be cultivated,
and this people here will be intelligent and intellectual:
the <em>mind</em> will rouse up, and claim its high
pre-eminence; woman will be elevated to her proper,
lofty sphere; brute force will yield to moral power;
and smiling plenty, and security, and happiness, will
prevail; and from our country will come the power
that is to effect this mighty change.</p>

<p>It is good sometimes to get far off from our land,
so that, as from an elevated spot, we may look over
the whole country; and, away from the influence of
local prejudice, and interest, and alarms, may scrutinize
our institutions, and examine into their permanency,
and see what strengthening and what counteracting
influences are at work to promise them
security. For myself, I have no fear for them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
They are built on <em>knowledge</em>; and, till we can
destroy for ever our printing presses, and can roll
back the age of ignorance, they are safe: they may
change their <em>forms</em>, but the substance will remain;
and always, and in every form, will liberty and
humanity be secure.</p>

<p>It is good also, sometimes to get away, and to be
able to compare our own country with others, and
be able thus to calculate the amount of prosperity
and happiness which we enjoy. In the clashings
of enterprise and rivalship among us, angry feelings
sometimes will arise. Europe is disgorging upon our
land the inmates of her prisons, and there will be
crime: the poor, the ignorant, and the oppressed of
her population find refuge here, and abundance; and,
in the wild joy at their newly-acquired comforts and
their freedom, they may run into riots and disorders;
but nowhere in the world is so much virtue to be
found as amid our population; and virtue is happiness.
We are a nation but of yesterday; and our railroads,
and canals, and steam-boats, and commerce,
are already a subject of astonishment; and what
will they be a few years hence?&mdash;and a century
after that?&mdash;and why may not the whole world be
like it? There is nothing, surely, to prevent this,
except Ignorance, and its twin-sister, Vice; but
knowledge, and with it virtue, are gone forth conquering
and to conquer, and their triumph will be
complete. It is a glorious thing to live in such
an age as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, reader, I turn and offer you my hand,
for the time when our companionship must cease has
at length arrived. I hope that we have been friends
during these journeyings, and that we part in kindness.
May Heaven bless you! Adieu!</p>

broke out at Alexandria, and raged with a violence that has scarcely
ever had a parallel. In the town of Atfour on the Nile, which,
when we passed it, had 40,000 inhabitants, in the course of a few
months only 1500 remained. Some had fled, but far the greater
part had been carried off by the disease. It swept quite through
the land from the sea-coast to the interior, sparing neither city nor
village, and was every where unusually fatal.</p></div>

the Egyptian Pyramids described by Mr. Wilford, declared at once
that they were religious structures; and inquired whether they had
not a subterraneous communication with the Nile. He described
the well in that of Cheops to them, when they affirmed that it was
for supplying the priests with water in their ceremonies, and that the
sarcophagus in the great chamber was on such occasions filled with
water and lotus-flowers. At Medun in Egypt is a Pyramid, with
broad off-setts like those of Mexico; and similar ones are stated to
exist on the banks of the Indus and Ganges.</p></div>

of his name) sent a large number of workmen here with orders to
destroy the Pyramids. They spent eight months, with pickaxes,
ropes, &amp;c., and put him to an enormous expense; but after all were
able only to disfigure one front of one, that of Mycerinus, the smallest
one. Even Saladin bade his workmen consider Memphis and
the Pyramids as quarries, from which to procure materials for
building the walls and the citadel of Cairo. Recent accounts from
Egypt state that Mohammed Ali is taking from the Pyramid of
Mycerinus materials for his great work at the Barage.</p></div>

autumn, and were planted by our friends last summer. They produced
vines in abundance, and fruit; but I have heard of but one

The failure of the others was perhaps owing to the shortness
and coldness of the season.</p></div>

both day and night, without any intermission, which cost them three
whole years before it was removed and brought to an entire level
with the plain of the rest of the city; after which the temple was
the highest of all the buildings. Now the citadel, as well as the
mountain on which it stood, was demolished.” Antiq. lib. xiii.

</p>
<p>
By the words, “to an entire level with the plain of the rest of the
city,” he cannot mean to a level with the plain of Zion; for in another
place (de Bel. lib. v. cap. iv. § 1.) he says that the upper
city, or Zion, was much higher than this; we must understand him
to say, that the peak was reduced to the general level of the rest of
Acra.</p></div>

be opposed to this. It is probable that his predecessors contemplated
such a wall, and made a commencement in one or two places; both
Pompey (B. C. 63) and Herod (B. C. 37), when they came to attack
Jerusalem, found this place quite naked, and made their assaults at
once on the temple and the second wall at Acra. Tacitus, Hist.
lib. v. cap. xii. has a passage bearing on this subject. “Moreover
the covetous temper that prevailed under Claudius gave the Jews an
opportunity of purchasing for money, leave to fortify Jerusalem; so
they built walls in time of peace as if they were going to war, they
being augmented in number by those rude multitudes of people that
retired thither on the ruin of the other cities.” Claudius reigned
from A. D. 41 to 54.</p></div>

The workmanship was well executed, and they make handsome

apple wood, pictures of fruit, &amp;c., with a very rich back-ground,
forming beautiful cabinet work. The Commodore offered him a

lib. v. cap. 5. § 1. The height of these walls must strike the reader as
almost beyond belief; and I confess that I hesitated about repeating
them from the Jewish historian, till I came to reflect on the size of
similar structures in other eastern cities. The walls of Nineveh
are reported on good authority to have been 100 feet in height, and
to have been strengthened by 1500 towers 200 feet in elevation. The
height of the temple of Belus, at Babylon, formed altogether of
bricks, is computed by Major Rennel at 500 feet, and by Prideaux
at 600; its ruins still form a mound 200 feet in height. The royal
palace in the same city was nearly as large as the temple; and the
ruins of a castle are still seen 140 feet in height, and half a mile in
circuit. The walls of this city were 34 miles in circuit&mdash;according
to some writers 60; and were broad enough for six chariots to drive
abreast upon them; and appear to have been originally 300, or 350
feet in height; having been reduced from this to 75 feet by Darius
Hystaspes in order to check the rebellious spirit of the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
The Egyptian pyramids still afford us a proof of the colossal nature
of such undertakings in ancient times. The largest two of these,
as has been already stated in this work, being 470 and 456 feet high,
by 704 and 654 on each side.
</p>
<p>
When we reflect on the sacred character of Jerusalem in the eyes
of all the Jews; how deeply the temple worship was wrought into
all their systems, both civil and religious; how earnest their zeal,
how entire their devotedness as regards this structure&mdash;we are prepared
for something extraordinary.
</p>
<p>
Josephus computes the number of “pure” persons who came up
yearly to the feast of the Passover at about 3,000,000. (De Bel.
lib. 11. cap. 14. § 3. lib. vi. cap. 9. § 3.) The vanity of the historian
may have led him to some exaggeration, but still the number was
prodigiously great. Many of these brought rich presents to the
temple, and all were ready to contribute their labor as well as means
whenever called upon. Agrippa, at one time, had 18,000 men employed
in repairing the Temple. (Jos. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. ix. § 7.)
Solomon employed 80,000 men to cut stone; 70,000 to transport the
materials, and 10,000 men constantly on Mount Lebanon to cut
wood for the Temple, and was seven years in completing it.
</p>
<p>
The space comprehended by these lofty walls was not entirely
filled with earth, a large portion being occupied with vaults and
subterranean passages. Their extent and the subsequent violence
will account for the complete abrasion of this mountain. See Jos.
de Bel. lib. v. cap. iii. § 1. Antiq. lib. xv. cap. ii. § 7.</p></div>

If the reader should think this account of the richness of the Temple
incredible, he is requested to consult ancient authors about
similar structures in other countries. The Parthenon at Athens
cost sixty millions of dollars; the Propylaea, or entrance to the
Acropolis, on which it stands, cost half as much; the statue of Minerva
in the former was of ivory and gold; the gold alone cost more
than half a million of dollars. The statue, decorations, and utensils
in the Temple of Belus, according to Diodorus Siculus, were equal in
value to more than 200 millions of our dollars. When Titus had
taken Jerusalem, gold was so abundant among his soldiers, that in
Syria a pound of it sold for half its former value. See Jos. de Bel.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
